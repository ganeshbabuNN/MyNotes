Overlaying Missing Data Values
In reality, you may have multiple copies of tables, some contain missings for different variables 
or records. You may use the COALESCE function to overlay same columns and returns 
the first nonmissing value that is found.

In this eample,
1. two tables contains same students' list with score1 and gender information
2. each table contains missing values for different students:
missings in one table, may have values in another table
3. combine the two tables to fill out the missings as much as possible

	from survey1 as s1 left join survey2 as s2
	on s1.staff_id = s2.staff_id and s1.employee_name = s2.employee_name 
	order by s1.staff_id;
