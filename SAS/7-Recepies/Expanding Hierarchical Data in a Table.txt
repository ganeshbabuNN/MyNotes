you want to create output that shows the name and ID number of each teacher who has a supervisor, along with the name and ID number of that teachers supervisor.

Uses self join to match teachers and their supervisors. When PROC SQL applies the WHERE clause, the two tables are joined. the WHERE clause conditions restrict the output to only those rows in table A that have a supervisor 

proc import datafile='C:\GBAG_Back\pyworkspace\datasets\sakila_datasets-xlsx\sakila_staffs'
	dbms=xlsx out=staff REPLACE;

proc sql;
	select s1.staff_id,
	       s1.employee_name,
		   s2.managerid,
		   s2.employee_name 'managerid'
	from staff as s1, staff as s2
	where s1.managerid=s2.staff_id;
quit;
