Differnt way to write hello world program
=========================================
Due to the stucture of SAS, there are three main ways to create "Hello World!" examples:

1)Within a data step to put a message into the SAS log (_null_ denotes that no output dataset should be created):

data _null_;
	put "hello world";
run;
 
2)Within a data step to store "Hello World!" within a variable (ganesh denotes that an output dataset called ganesh should be created that 
a)contains only one record and 
b)contains only one variable: var2 , which has a value of Hello World! ):

data ganesh;
	bar="Hello world" ; 
	put bar;
run;
 
3)Via the SAS Macro language (in 'open code' outside of any data steps). 
& identifies a call to a macro variable and 
.identifies the end of the variable (if a white space character is not wanted)

%let var1=Hello;
%put &var1.O world;

4)Hybrid: Using a macro variable within a data step:
%let var1=Hello;

data _null_;
	put "&var1 world!";
run;


File Extensions
===================
The SAS programs, data files and the results of the programs are saved with various extensions 
*.sas − It represents the SAS code file which can be edited using the SAS Editor or any text editor.
*.log − It represents the SAS Log File it contains information such as errors, warnings, and data set details for a submitted SAS program.
*.mht / *.html− It represents the SAS Results file.
*.sas7bdat −It represents SAS Data File which contains a SAS data set including variable names, labels, and the results of calculations.
