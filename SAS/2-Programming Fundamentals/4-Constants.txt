-A SAS constant is a number or a character string that indicates a fixed value. 
-Constants can be used as expressions in many SAS statements, including variable assignment and IF-THEN statements
-Constants are also called literals.

The following are types of SAS constants:

character
numeric
date, time, and datetime

Using Quotation Marks with Character Constants
============================================

In the following SAS statement, Tom is a character constant:

name='Giri';

If a character constant includes a single quotation mark, enclose it in double quotation marks

name="Giri's";

SAS treats the two consecutive quotation marks as one quotation mark
name='Giri''s';

The same principle holds true for double quotation mark
name="Giri""s";

example:
data _null_;
	name='Giri';
	name="Giri's";
	name='Giri''s';
	name="Giri""s";
	put name;
run;

Comparing Character Constants and Character Variables
=====================================================
-It is important to remember that character constants are enclosed in quotation marks,
-but names of character variables are not
-This distinction applies wherever you can use a character constant, such as in titles, footnotes, labels, and other descriptive strings; in option values; 

title 'This''is a title';
data ganesh; 
	name="Giri""s";
	put name;
run;
proc print data=ganesh;
run;
footnote 'This''s a footnote';
