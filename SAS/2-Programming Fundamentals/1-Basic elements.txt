Algorithms
==========
-algorithms are used to create the logic for specific operations.

Word
====
A word or token in the SAS programming language is a collection of characters that communicates a meaning to SAS
-A word or token ends when SAS encounters one of the following:
1)the beginning of a new token
2)a blank after a name or a number token
3)the ending quotation mark of a literal token

Type of token
-------------
names
literals
numbers
special characters

name:
-is a series of characters that begin with a letter or an underscore. Later characters can include letters, underscores, and numeric digits.
-however, SAS names are limited to a shorter maximum length,
data
_new
yearcutoff
year_99
descending
_n_

literal:
-consists of 1 to 32,767 bytes enclosed in single or double quotation marks. Here are some examples of literals
'Chicago'
"1990-91"
'Amelia Earhart'
'Amelia Earhart''s plane'
"Report for the Third Quarter"

number
-in general, is composed entirely of numeric digits, with an optional decimal point and a leading plus or minus sign

special character
-is usually any single keyboard character other than letters, numbers, the underscore, and the blank

keywords
========
are nothing but the reserved words
data
run
_null_
if
where

Identifiers
===========
In SAS , there called as names ,generally refers to the name given by the users for a variable, data step name, function name label , libname, filerefe name.....

operators
=========
performing any calculations between the two operands using operators (symbols)

3 + 4 = 6

3 and  is a operands
+ is Additions operators
= assignment operators

-You shall learn different types of operators 

Syntax
======
The set of rules

like Date Step , proce step and output step.

Statements
==============
A SAS statement is a string of SAS keywords, SAS names, special characters, and operators that instructs SAS to perform an operation or that gives information to SAS. 
Each SAS statement ends with a semicolon

-Statements can start anywhere and end anywhere. A semicolon at the end of the last line marks the end of the statement.
-Many SAS statements can be on the same line, with each statement ending with a semicolon
-Space can be used to separate the components in a SAS program statement.
-SAS keywords are not case sensitive.
-Every SAS program must end with a RUN statement
-For every PROC SQL statement must end with QUIT Statment.
-there are global statement used as in GRAPH

There are two types of statements form:
1)Simple statement
2)Compund statment

1)Simple statement:- 
simple statements may occur on a single line separated by semicolons
drop , var ,

2)compound statement 
compound statements span multiple lines
:- case ,select 

and there are different type of statement as well.
1)local statement : like var,drop...etc
2)global statement : like libname , filerefname..etc

Expressions
===========
-Expression is a statement if there are any one operator in it.
-It is  sequence of operands and operators that form a set of instructions that are performed to produce a resulting value. 
SAS expressions can resolve to numeric values, character values, or Boolean values

ex:
(2+3) = 5   ==> Arthmetic expression
(2 < 3) =   ==> Logical expression

indentations
============
- indentations are used in statements, variables ...etc
sames cases :
using in keep, drop  , var statment , varaibles are mantined in space.

Comments in SAS
================
Comments in SAS code are specified in two ways. 
Below are these two formats.
1)
-for single comment
* This is comment ;
-for multi line comment
* This is first line of the comment
* This is second line of the comment;

2)
-for single comment
/* This is comment */
-for multi line comment
/* This is first line of the comment
* This is second line of the comment */

SAS Data Set
============
The DATA statement marks the creation of a new SAS data set
-A single word after the DATA statement indicates a temporary data set name. Which means the data set gets erased at the end of the session
-The data set name can be prefixed with a library name which makes it a permanent data set
-If the SAS data set name is omitted then SAS creates a temporary data set with a name generated by SAS like - DATA1, DATA2 

# Temporary data sets.
DATA TempData;
DATA abc;
DATA newdat;

# Permanent data sets.
DATA LIBRARY1.DATA1
DATA MYLIB.newdat;
