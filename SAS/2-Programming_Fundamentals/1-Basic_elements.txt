Intro
=====
In any of the languages there are two internal engine where the language is controlled and execute.
compiler --> it checks the grammers, syntax of the program what you write where the sas engine handovers to compiler, 
	if any error which is reported by the compiler are showsin the log windows
intrepreter --> once compilers completes the checking the syntax without any error, then intrepreter executes the program i,e code and shows in result/datasets/log windows

Algorithms
==========
-algorithms are used to create the logic for specific operations.

Word
====
A word or token in the SAS programming language is a collection of characters that communicates a meaning to SAS
-A word or token ends when SAS encounters one of the following:
1)the beginning of a new token
2)a blank after a name or a number token
3)the ending quotation mark of a literal token

Type of token
-------------
names
literals
numbers
special characters

name:
-is a series of characters that begin with a letter or an underscore. Later characters can include letters, underscores, and numeric digits.
-however, SAS names are limited to a shorter maximum length,
data
_new
yearcutoff
year_99
descending
_n_

literal:
-consists of 1 to 32,767 bytes enclosed in single or double quotation marks. Here are some examples of literals
'Chicago'
"1990-91"
'Amelia Earhart'
'Amelia Earhart''s plane'
"Report for the Third Quarter"

number
-in general, is composed entirely of numeric digits, with an optional decimal point and a leading plus or minus sign

special character
-is usually any single keyboard character other than letters, numbers, the underscore, and the blank

keywords
========
are nothing but the reserved words
data
run
_null_
if
where

Identifiers
===========
In SAS , there called as names ,generally refers to the name given by the users for a variable, data step name, function name label , libname, filerefe name.....

operators
=========
performing any calculations between the two operands using operators (symbols)

3 + 4 = 6

3 and  is a operands
+ is Additions operators
= assignment operators

-You shall learn different types of operators 

Syntax
======
The set of rules

like Date Step , proce step and output step.

Statements
==============
A SAS statement is a string of SAS keywords, SAS names, special characters, and operators that instructs SAS to perform an operation or that gives information to SAS. 
Each SAS statement ends with a semicolon

-Statements can start anywhere and end anywhere. A semicolon at the end of the last line marks the end of the statement.
-Many SAS statements can be on the same line, with each statement ending with a semicolon
-Space can be used to separate the components in a SAS program statement.
-SAS keywords are not case sensitive.
-Every SAS program must end with a RUN statement
-For every PROC SQL statement must end with QUIT Statment.
-there are global statement used as in GRAPH

There are two types of statements form:
1)Simple statement
2)Compund statment

1)Simple statement:- 
simple statements may occur on a single line separated by semicolons
drop , var ,

2)compound statement 
compound statements span multiple lines
:- case ,select 

and there are different type of statement as well.
1)local statement : like var,drop...etc
2)global statement : like libname , filerefname..etc

Expressions
===========
-Expression is a statement if there are any one operator in it.
-It is  sequence of operands and operators that form a set of instructions that are performed to produce a resulting value. 
SAS expressions can resolve to numeric values, character values, or Boolean values

ex:
(2+3) = 5   ==> Arthmetic expression
(2 < 3) =   ==> Logical expression

indentations
============
- indentations are used in statements, variables ...etc
sames cases :
using in keep, drop  , var statment , varaibles are mantined in space.

Comments in SAS
================
Comments in SAS code are specified in two ways. 
Below are these two formats.
1)
-for single comment
* This is comment ;
-for multi line comment
* This is first line of the comment
* This is second line of the comment;

2)
-for single comment
/* This is comment */
-for multi line comment
/* This is first line of the comment
* This is second line of the comment */

SAS Data Set
============
The DATA statement marks the creation of a new SAS data set
-A single word after the DATA statement indicates a temporary data set name. Which means the data set gets erased at the end of the session
-The data set name can be prefixed with a library name which makes it a permanent data set
-If the SAS data set name is omitted then SAS creates a temporary data set with a name generated by SAS like - DATA1, DATA2 

# Temporary data sets.
DATA TempData;
DATA abc;
DATA newdat;

# Permanent data sets.
DATA LIBRARY1.DATA1
DATA MYLIB.newdat;
