ORDER BY Clause: Sort Data

ORDER BY Clause: Sort Data 
==========================
Overview
(1) When you use an ORDER BY clause, you change the order of the output but not the order of 
the rows that are stored in the table.
(2) The PROC SQL default sort order is ascending. To order the results, specify ASC for ascending or DESC for descending. 
(3) You can specify a sort order for each column in the ORDER BY clause. When you specify multiple columns in the ORDER BY clause, 
the first column determines the primary row order of the results. Subsequent columns determine the order of rows 
that have the same value for the primary sort.
(4) PROC SQL sorts nulls, or missing values, before character or numeric data. 
Therefore, when you specify ascending order, missing values appear first in the query results. 

-sort by one or multiple coulumns (the column names separated by commas)
Note: The results list stduent with missing Gender first 
because PROC SQL sorts missing values first in an ascending sort

proc import datafile='C:\GBAG_Back\pyworkspace\datasets\sakila_datasets-xlsx\sakila_surveys'
dbms=xlsx out=survey1 REPLACE ;
run;

-order by numeric category missing sorts first by ascending
proc sql;
	select * 
	from survey1
	order by depid asc;
quit;

-order by character category 
------------------------------
proc sql;
	select * 
	from survey1
	order by gender desc;
quit;

-order by more than one variable
------------------------------
proc sql;
	select * 
	from survey1
	order by gender,depid;
quit;

-Sorting by Calculated Column
------------------------------
-You can sort by a calculated column by specifying its alias in the ORDER BY clause. */

proc sql;
	select *,
		   mean(survey1,survey2,survey3,survey4) as survey_mean format 4.1
	from survey1
	order by survey_mean;
quit;

-Sorting by Column Position
---------------------------
-You can sort by any column within the SELECT clause by specifying its numerical position. 
-By specifying a position instead of a name, 
-you can sort by a calculated column that has no alias

proc sql;
	select staff_id,
		   survey1,
		   survey2,
		   survey3,
		   survey4,
		   gender,
		   mean(survey1,survey2,survey3,survey4) as survey_mean format 4.1,
		   depid
	from survey1
	order by 1,5,7;
quit;

-Sorting by Columns That Are Not Selected
-----------------------------------------
-You can sort query results by columns that are not included in the query. 

proc sql;
	select staff_id,
		   survey1,
		   survey2,
		   survey3,
		   survey4,
/*		   gender,*/
		   mean(survey1,survey2,survey3,survey4) /*as survey_mean format 4.1*/,
		   depid
	from survey1
	order by 7 desc,1 desc;
quit;
