Querying data from all columns of a table
Query data from a single column
Querying data from multiple columns

Intro
=====
-people form the SQL background can easyily learn the SAS using procSQL

syntax:
PROC SQL;
 SELECT column(s)
 FROM table(s) | view(s)
 WHERE expression
 GROUP BY column(s)
 HAVING expression
 ORDER BY column(s);
QUIT;


Examples
PROC SQL: calls the SQL procedure
SELECT: specifies the column(s) (variables) to be selected
FROM: specifies the table(s) (data sets) to be queried
WHERE: subsets the data based on a condition
GROUP BY: classifies the data into groups based on the specified column(s)
ORDER BY: sorts the resulting rows (observations) by the specified column(s)
QUIT: ends the PROC SQL procedure

The SELECT statement is the primary tool of PROC SQL. You can use it to retrieve data from a table. You can use several optional clauses within the SELECT statement to place restrictions on a query.

SELECT and FROM Clauses The SELECT statement must contain a SELECT clause and a FROM clause, both of which are requiredin a PROC SQL query. 

For example:
/*display the title,release_year, rental_year from flim table*/
 select title from flim;

This SELECT statement contains the following: A SELECT clause that lists the column ‘title ’,FROM clause that lists the table 'flim',
which contains the ‘title’ column.

proc import datafile = "C:\GBAG_Back\pyworkspace\datasets\sakila_datasets-xlsx\sakila_staffs" 
DBMS = xlsx out = staff replace ;
run; 

Querying data from all columns of a table
=========================================
-Selecting Columns in a Table When you retrieve data from a table, you can select one or more columns by using variations of the basic SELECT statement.
-Use an asterisk in the SELECT clause to select all columns in a table.

proc sql;
select * 
from staff;
run;

Query data from a single column
===============================
-If you want to select more than one column, then you must separate the names of the columns with commas

proc sql;
select first_name 
from staff;
run;

Querying data from multiple columns
===================================

proc sql;
select first_name,last_name,DOB,hiredate
from staff;
run;

using keep statement 
--------------------
-This statement can be used as a paraemter with or a datasets
proc sql;
select *
from staff(keep=first_name last_name DOB hiredate);
run;
