Magrittr Forward Pipe %>%
=========================
-Often we want to perform multiple functions to our data (e.g. filter, then group, then summarise)
-We can do this by nesting our functions within one another, but the code quickly becomes confusing and difficult to follow (we can also use assignments but that’s even more wasteful)
		functionCfunctionB functionA (data)))

-%>% enables a stepwise, methodical code where the previous step is transferred or “piped” into the next step, so that we no longer need to consider it
-Think of %>% as saying “now do”
	functionB %>% functionA %>% functionC %>%  data

-For example, in the health data set we might want to calculate average height of the different gender groups for people younger than 50
-Without %>% we get a confusing nested function code, which is difficult to follow
	summarise(group_by(filter(health, age < 50), gender), avg_height = mean(height))
-%>% we get a more methodical code that is far more understandable
	health %>%
	filter(age < 50) %>%
	group_by(gender) %>%
	summarise(avg_height = mean(height))


#Answers to example questions for %>%
health %>% mutate(bmi = weight/(height/100)^2)
health %>% filter(gender == "M" & age >30) %>% summarise(av_weight = mean(weight))
health %>% arrange(desc(age)) %>% slice(n())


intro to Tibbles
================
-A tibble, or tbl_df, is a modern reimagining of the data.frame, keeping what time has proven to be effective, and throwing out what is not
-Tibbles are data.frames that are lazy and surly: they do less (i.e. they don’t change variable names or types, and don’t do partial matching) and complain more (e.g. when a variable does not exist)
-tibble() does much less than data.frame(): 
it never changes the type of the inputs (e.g. it never converts strings to factors!), 
it never changes the names of variables, 
it only recycles inputs of length 1, and it never creates row.names(). 
You can read more about these features in vignette("tibble")
-The tibble print method draws inspiration from data.table, and frame. Like data.table::data.table(), 
tibble() doesn’t coerce strings to factors by default, doesn’t change column names, and doesn’t use rownames.
installations
-------------
install.packages("tibble")

which contain all the packages
install.packages("tidyverse")

Create tibble from dataframe
----------------------------
library(tibble)
as_tibble(iris)

Create tibble from vector
-------------------------
tibble(x = 1:5, y = 1, z = x ^ 2 + y)

define a tibble row-by-row with tribble()
-----------------------------------------
tribble(
  ~x, ~y,  ~z,
  "a", 2,  3.6,
  "b", 1,  8.5
)
