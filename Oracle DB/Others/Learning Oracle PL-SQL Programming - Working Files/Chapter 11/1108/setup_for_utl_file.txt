Create a directory in the operating system

mkdir \emp_demo

Once you have the actual directory on the drive, create a directory at the database level. 

You may need to access the database as a DBA or have the permission create directory assigned to you account.

If you are using the HR account, you can log in as sysdba and 

GRANT create any directory TO hr;

or create the directory and grant read write access to HR. 


As HR, run this to create the directory.

CREATE OR REPLACE DIRECTORY file_dir AS 'C:\emp_demo';
