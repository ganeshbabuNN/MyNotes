- this function produces a forest of XML elemetns from the given list of arguments
-means produces many XML elements at a time.
-it basically concates the XML elements together without having to use the concatentation operator[||] with multiple calls to XMLELEMENT()


XMLAgg()

-this is used typicall for grouping XML together into a common list of itemsn of one pareent or for retrieving data from collections-it allows using ORDER BY Clause
