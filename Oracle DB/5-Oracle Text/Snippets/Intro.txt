Intro
=====
-A standard SQL query allows matching strings available in the DB, however, since the Text has increased, standard string matching functions will not help. 
-To Allow performing much more than string matches Oracke, has introduced, new text search features via a tool called Oracle Text, a Complete Text Search solutions, which is part of the oracle standard and enterprise editions
-It preivously known as intermedia Text and Context, is an extensive full text indexing technology that allows building text queries, support multiple languages and uses advanced relevance-ranking technology to improve search quality.

Oracle Text uses Standard SQL to Index, search and analyize
a)Text
b)Documents stored in the Oracle DB
c)document files
d)files on the Web

it allows using a variety of search strategies such as
a)Keyword searching
b)Context queries
c)Boolean Operations
d)Pattern matching
e)Mixed Thematic queries
f)HTML/XML Sections searching

it allows rendering search results in various formats such as
a)Unformatted text
b)HTML with term highlighting
c)Orginal document format

-Oracle text allows full-text retrievel against virtually any data type[Including all LOB Types],The indexing and searching abilities of Oracle Text are not restricted to data stored in the DB.
-It can index and search documents stored on the file system and index more than 150 document types including MS Word ,PDF and XML.

Oracle Text Index
===============
-To enable Oracle Text Search on the desired table columns, an oracle Text index is required.
-Creating an Oracle Text index completely diff from creating any other DB index.

Oracle Text Index Types
=======================
***This covers only basics CONTEXT and CTXCAT indexes.
-Three Types of Text Indexes that cover all text search needs
1)Standard
2)Catalog
3)Classification

1)Standard index[CONTEXT]
-------------------------
-This type of index is useful for traditional full-text retrievel over documents and web pages
-The CONTEXT index type provides a rich set of text search capabilities for finding the desired content,without returning pages of spurious results
-Use This index to build a text retrievel a application when the text searched for hold large coherent documents
-This index can be applied to diff documents formats such as MS word,HTML,XML or plain text.
-The operator that is used to query the text is CONTAINS
-*This index works likea normal B-Tree index. it creates a set of tables that comprise an inverted list index on the text column.The inverted index is effectively the same as the one found in a paper book. It matches a token or phrase and its locations to speed up search with a look-up rather than a scan

Sytnax
	CONTAINS(<ColumnName>,<SearchString>)
*The contains function accepts the following two parameter
1)ColumnName
2)SearchString


2)Catalog Index[CTXCAT]
-----------------------
-This type of index is useful for eBussiness catalogs .
-The CTXCAT catalog index type provides flexible searching and sorting at web-speed
-Use This index Type to index small text fragments such as item names, prices and descriptions that are stored across columns
-The Operator that is used to query the text is CATSEARCH

syntax
	CATSEARCH(<ColumnName>,<SearchString>,<IndexSetName>)
*The CATSEARCH functions accepts the following three parameters
1)ColumnName
2)SearchString
3)IndexSetName
-Current, since no index set exists, the third parameter is passed as NULL.
-The CATSEARCH functions does not return a score. However, the >0 is allowed to ease the migrations from CONTEXT index to CTXCAT


3)Classication index[CTXRULE]
-----------------------------
-This type of index is useful for building classification or routing applications.
-The CTXRULE index type is created on a table of queries, where the queries define the classification or routing criteria
-Use This index to build a document classification application. this index is an index created on a table of queries,where each query has a classification.
-This operator that is usef to query the text is MATCHES


Creating Indexes
================
-to use the Oracle Text, text indexes need to be created on the column that holds the text to be searched.
-A Text index is a collection of indexes and tables that oracle creates when an index creations process is initiated by the user.
-These indexes and tables hold informations about the text stored in the column and are created to support the text queries fired.
-Before Creating a text index on the table column,it is mandatory to have a primary key set on the table.
-To create the text index, use the CREATE INDEX command.

Difference CONTEXT and CTXCAT index
-----------------------------------
-CTXCAT index supports transactional synchronization between the base table and the text index
-In case of the CONTEXT index, this needs to be done manually after data changes in the base table as:

INDEX SYNC PARAMETER
=====================

ALTER INDEX <IndexName> REBUILD ONLINE PARAMETER('SYNC');

-Other than this difference , the query syntax remains the same.
-Oracle DB 10g onwards, the CONTEXT index can be maintained on commits or at specific intervals using the SYNC parameter.

Syntax
	SYNC (MANUAL|EVERY<Interval>|ON COMMIT);
