CONSTRUCTORS
=============

As discussing A record type is just a data struture where all the attributes comprises into a unit where as in object is contains multiples field i,e attributes but the diff is in the field we can include code with it as i said before object type is a combinations of package and complex types.
-- the record data struture and package strutues will be used in various situationsin PLSQL
-- by default the this type, default construtors. this is done by the oracle
--the sample code like like this.

Object_Type_Constructor_SELF_Like a Package.sql

-- like how you have package body and the spec, here also object body can be return for the code.
Object_Type_Constructor_SELF_Like a Package.sql

'SELF' this is trying to assigning the body to the instance of the object
Object_Type_Constructor_SELF_Like a Package.sql

---let us call the object that is is emp_obj
Object_Type_Constructor_SELF_Like a Package.sql

Constructor Attributes
-----------------------
---Now creating the construtor , passing without any attribute and with only one attribule
Object_Type_Constructor_Parmeterised_SELF.sql

---adding the implementation for the body of above type
Object_Type_Constructor_Parmeterised_SELF.sql

Initializing the Empty Constructor
----------------------------------
-same you can even put some initializing value into the empty constructor.
Object_Type_Constructor_Attributes_Initialization.sql

-now call the object, by default other attributes are called with that constructure, which is called by the constructors.
