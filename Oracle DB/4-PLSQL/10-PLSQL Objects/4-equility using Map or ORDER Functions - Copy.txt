COMPARE the objects with quality and comparison sessions
========================================================
-In real world , comparing the objects will bit complex apart from the straight comparison with equality of scalar values like number to number, String to String, letter to letter
-let us show some example which does not work..

Object_Type_Comparing_The_Object_Wrong.sql

the above code has some error"ORA-06550: line 22, column 16:
PLS-00526: A MAP or ORDER function is required for comparing objects in PL/SQL.
06550. 00000 -  "line %s, column %s:\n%s"
*Cause:    Usually a PL/SQL compilation error."

Anyway for comparing objects, we need to MAP or ORDER FUnction in PLSQL.

MAP MEMBER
==========
-MAP MEMBER function is a simplest type of functions and map returns the scalar value when try to compare and the return compared result must be a valid sql data type like boolean, string ,number ...etc
-rewriting the above code using MAP MEMEBER

Object_Type_Comparing_The_Object_MapMember_Correct.sql

****and now call the  MAP MEMBER FUnction to check how the objects is compared
-Now call call_emp_obj6.sql and check the output. 
-match the attributes of the objects and check the output.

ORDER MEMBER FUNCTIONS
======================

-ORDER Function can be used , since it passes one instance of one object to another instance object which gives the uniqness -it always return 1(it means greater then the other) ,0(mean equal to other) and -1(less then the other)
let take one example
Object_Type_Comparing_The_Object_OrderMember.sql

***and now call the  MAP MEMBER FUnction to check how the objects is compared
-Now call call_emp_obj7.sql and check the output. 
-match the attributes of the objects and check the output.

test again
-match the email and check the output
-match email and salary and check the output
