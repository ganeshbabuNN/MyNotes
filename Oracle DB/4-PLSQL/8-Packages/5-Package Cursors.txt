Package cursors
================

-we can even package a cursors and reused by any users.
-example using a simple cursors

declare
  cursor c1 is
  select first_name,last_name,email,phone_number,hire_date
  from employees
  where employee_id =101;
 v_local_record c1%ROWTYPE;
begin
  select first_name,last_name,email,phone_number,hire_date
  into v_local_record
  from employees
  where employee_id =101;
  
  dbms_output.put_line(v_local_record.first_name || '  ' || v_local_record.last_name);
end;
/

--- you can make this cursors packages, you can make this select statements avaiable globally, so anyone can reference the select statements where can be reused globally .

--if you want to hide the cursor statement into a package body, let us rework on it, where it works exactly the same. Basically you are hiding the implementations of the cursors. its a good pratice code hiding is a good pratice which is given b the packages.
