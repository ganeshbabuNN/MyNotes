Intro
======
-PL/SQL allows writing subprograms
-A subprograms is a named block of code block made up of logically grouped SQL and PL/SQL statements that perform a specific task.

A Subprogram
------------
-Allows to write PL/SQL programs to meet the requirements
-Breakings the PL/SQL prgoram into management modules
-allows resuing of code spec and thus improve code maintainablity
-Enforces security by giving appropriate permission, on a procedure or funciton querying a paritcular table , to users
-improve db performance as no compilation is required to execute the procedure or functions

subprogram can be classified into
---------------------------------
-Procedures
-Functions

-Both Procedures and functions can be invoked by an PL/SQL code block that appears within an appplication .
-Before procedure or function is stored, the oracle engine parses and compiler the procedure or functions.
-these subprograms are compiled and stored in the Oracle DB as stored programs. since these program are stored in compiled form, whenever they are invoked, only program execution takes place
-A procedures or functions when executed is processed on the Oracle DB server, thus reduces network traffic.s


Section of Procedures and Functions
===================================
-Every subprogram i,e procedures and functions are made up of:

Declarations section
--------------------
-the Declarative section usually holds the declarations of
a)Cursors
b)Constants
c)Variables
d)Exceptions
e)Subprograms
-these declarations are local to the subprogram and become invalid once the subprogram i,e procedures or functions exits

Executable Sections
-------------------
-this holds SQL and PL/SQL statements that helps achieve the purpose for which procedures or function is written and holds code spec that
*Assigns value to variables
*Controls executions
*Manipulates table data
*Returns data to the calling environment after completing processing the code spec.
-the variables are declared in the declarative section are used within this code blcok.

Exception Handling section
--------------------------
-THis exception handling seciton holds exceptions [if any] that may be raised during the executin of code block in the executable sections
-the congfrol from the exception handling section cannot be shifted to the executable paDrt

Difference between procedures Vs Functions
=========================================
steps		Procedures						FUnctions
-----		----------						---------
Return value	A procedure may return one ore more value through 	a function always return a value using the return 
		parameter or may not return values at all.		statement
Multiple Return	By defining multiple OUT Parameter in a procedures,	A Function can return only one value to the calling
value		mulitple values can be passed/returned to the caller.   PL/SQL Code block.
		the OUT variable beging global by nature, its value is 
		accessible by any PL/SQL code block including the PL/SQL
		block via which it was called
SQL Select	A SELECT query can call a function			A SELECT SQL query cannot call a procedures
Queries
DML Queries	DML Statements can be used in procedures		DML Statements cannot be used in functions
When to 	if it is desried to update product prices, a procedure	if it is desired to retrieve the mpeloyee number 
Create		ie prefered						[code] for a particular employee, a function is pre										-ferred.
