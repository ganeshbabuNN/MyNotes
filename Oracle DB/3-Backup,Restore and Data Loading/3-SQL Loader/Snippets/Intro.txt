Intro
=====
-SQL*Loader is Utility supplied with Oracle DB. this allows loading data from a flat file into one or more DB tables in Oracle
-it is also known as control file.The control file is a text file that holds
*-Description of the data to be loaded
*-informations about Database tables and column that will receive the data being loaded.
-It is ready to begin the Load process, once a data file to load and a control file describing the data contained in the data file is available.
*-Is passed the control file and the input file
*-Reads the control file to get a description of the data to be loaded
*-Reads the input file and loads the input data into the Database
-It is utitlity is very useful when it is required to load data from other data sources into the Oracle Database
Exp. data sources such as FoxPro,MS Access,Sybase or any other Third party DB systems can be loaded into the Oracle DB using SQL*Loader
-To achieve this
1)Convert the source data into:
	a)Delimited format flat file
	b)Fixed length format flat file
2)Pass it to SQL*Loader along with a control file describing the data to be loaded.
3)SQL*Loader
	a)Reads the control file to get a descriptions of the data to be loaded
	b)Reads the input[Flat] file and loads the input data into the DB.


Writing the Control File for comma separated file
=================================================
LOAD DATA
INFILE 'path'
BADFILE 'path'
DISCARDFILE ''
INSERT INTO Table <Tablename>
FIELD TERMINATED BY "," OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"' TRAILING
NULLCOLS(<column_name1>,<column_name2>,<column_name3>,<column_name4>)

Where
**The LOAD DATA statements is required at the begining of the control file
**The INFILE options specifies where the input file is located
**Specifying BADFILE is optional.If Specified, then bad records found during loading are stored in the file
**Specifying DISCARDFILE is optional. if specified , then records which do not meets a WHEN Conditions are written to this file.
**Any of the following loading options can be used
-INSERT: Loads rows only if the target table is empty
-APPEND:Loads rows if the target table is empty or not empty
-REPLACE:First deletes all the rows in the existing table and then, load rows
-TRUNCATE: first truncates the tables and then load rows
**FIELDS TERMINATED BY indicates how the fields are separated in input file. Since in this case the fields are separated by ",", the same is indicated here
**TRAILING NULLCOLS indicates if the last column is null then treat this as null value, so SQL*LOADER treats the record as bad if the last column is null

--Save the control file as <FileName>.ctl
--Invoke SQL*Lader utility as
sqldr userid=ganesh/<password> control=<filename>.ctl log=<filename>.log

**the LOG Options specifies the name of the log file for the SQL*Loader session. The LOG file holds all the actions performed by SQL*Loader such as
1)How many rows were Loaded
2)How Many were rejected
3)How much time is taken to load the rows
**This file is useful to detemine error[if any] encountered while running SQL*Loader

Writing the Control File for Fixed Length file
==============================================

LOAD DATA
INFILE '/Mydata/employees.txt'
INTO Table employees
(employee_no POSITION(01,09) INTEGER EXTERNAL,
first_name POSITION(10,30) CHAR,
last_name POSITION(29,44) CHAR,
salary POSITION(45,54) INTEGER EXTERNAL,
dept_no POSITION(55,59) INTEGER EXTERNAL,
gender POSITION(1,10) CHAR
)

WHERE
**The LOAD DATA statements is required at the begining of the control file
**the name of the file containing data follows the INFILE parameter
**the INTO TABLE statements is required to identify the table to be loaded into
**Column names are specified using()
**The data types (INTEGER EXTERNAL, CHAR,DECIMAL,EXTERNAL) identify the data type of data fields in the file, not of the corresponding columns in the employees table in Oracle DB
