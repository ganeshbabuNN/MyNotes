Creating Table
==============
- it defines command uniquely defines each column of the table
-A column has the following three attributes
1)Column name
2)the data type
3)Column size

Syntax
------

CREATE TABLE <TableName>(
<ColumnName> <DataType>(<Size> [Primary Key] [NOT NULL|NULL][Default]),
<ColumnName> <DataType>(<Szie> [Primary Key] [NOT NULL|NULL][Default]),..
);

-Each column that is defined in a table must have data type
-Each Column Definition is a single clause in the CREATE TABLE Syntax
-Each Table Column Definition is separation from the other by a comma.
-Finally, The SQL statement is terminated with a semi colon.

Rules
-----
1)A Table name can have maximum up to 30 characters
2)Alphabets from A-Z ,a-z and numbers from 0-9 are allowed
3)A Name should begin with an alphabet.
4)the use of special character like _ is allowed and also recommended[Special character such as $,# are allowed only in Oracle)
5)Reserved words are not allowed. For exp.. Create,select and so on.

Steps to followed before creating a Table.
-----------------------------------------
1)what are columns of the rows to be stored?
2)what are the data types of the columns and their respectie sizes?
3)which column will be the record identifier[usually called primary key]?
4)which columns do /do not allow null values?
5)which columns do / do not allows duplicates?
6)are there default values for certain columns?

Temporary Tables
================
-Some of the complicated process that cannot be completed, we may require some temporary data store.
-Here Temporary data stores are usually used to improve performance when running complex and expensive queries.The results that complex query retreives are cached in a temporary able.
-Example : Application updated the rows -->to the temporary table --> persistent table.
-the data held by these tables, is automatically deleted at the end of the transaction or a session, depending upon the kind of temporary table. the data in that table are private.
-data inserted in that session can only be access by thats session only

Syntax
------

CREATE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE <tableName> (
<ColumnName> <DataType>,
<ColumnName> <DataType>) ON COMMIT DELETE ROWS;

-the on commit delete rows clause indicates that the data should be deleted at the end of the transactions

CREATE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE <tableName> (
<ColumnName> <DataType>,
<ColumnName> <DataType>) ON COMMIT PRESERVE ROWS;

-the ON COMMIT PRESERVE ROWS clause indicates that rows should be preserved until the end of the session.

-By Creating the temprory table
a)View can be created
b)Triggers can be associated
c)Indexes can be created

-If the TRUNCATE Statement is isued against a temporary table, only the session specific data is truncated. there is no affect on the data of other sessions.

Creating a Table from a Table
=============================
-For Recorganizing an oracle table or moving a table to another tablespace, the CREATE TABLE AS SELECT Command is used.
-this command
1)structures and creates a new table
2)copies data from the existing table to the new table
3)renames the new table

syntax
------
CREATE TABLE <TableName>(<ColumnName>,<ColumnName>) AS SELECT <ColumnName>,<ColumeName> FROM <TableName>

-the table name in the SELECT Query is the source table from where the data will be picked up
-The table name in the CREATE TABLE statement is the Target table which will be created and populated within the data.
-A table can also be created without copying any data [i,e create the structure only]from the source table. USE WHERE Clause if the condition is false, it creates the data without data.
