intro
=====
-PsuedoColumns passes additional information of the row
-its is not actually part of rows as other columns but exists due to row property
-you cannot modify or update psuedo-columns,but use to retrieve data

different types
---------------
1) the LEVEL pseduo-columns
2) the ROWID Pseduo-columns
3) the ROWNUM Pseduo-columns
4) the ROWSCN Pseduo-columns
5) the SYDATE Pseduo-columns
6) the UID Pseduo-columns
7) the USER Pseduo-columns


1) the LEVEL pseduo-columns
---------------------------
-it returns of a row in a tree-structured query.
-it returns level 1 for a root node , the child node has one additional level than the parent.
-it is used along with connect by i used.

2) the ROWID Pseduo-columns
---------------------------
-gives the loaction of row on disk in the database where the row is physicall stored

let us the first rowid AAAR5kAAFAAAADNABK
-AAAR5k it represent the data object number that identifies the db segement. schema objects in the same segement, such as  cluster of tables, have the same data object number.
-AAF represents file number that identifies the data file, which contains the row. file number unique within a database
-AAAADN- represents the block number that identifies that data block, which contains the row. BLOCK numbers are relative are relative to their data file, not their tablespace
-ABK represents rwo number that identifies the row in the block

Deleting Duplicates Rows
------------------------
-A table called customers holds duplicates rows
-To Achieve this,a record should be uniquely identifiable which in this case seems impossible as all column values hold duplicate data, which disallows unique identification of a row that is to be retained
-In such a scenario, oracle pseudo column RowID can be put in use. A Row ID will always be unique for every record in the table, A rowID will always be unique for every record in the table, even if those records holds duplicate daEta.
-Every record in a table is stored within a block in the data file. Each record in a block is given a unique record number.Thus at any time, the value in the rowID column will alwas be unique.
-THis is only the solution that can be applied to retain one single record and delete the duplicate records for the same customers.
-THis SQL query groups duplicate records and amongest these duplicate records since one record has to be retained, the ROWID that is the lowest amongst the duplicate records is extracted.
-the first row in each set of duplicate records is extracted using the MIN functions that returns the min value from a set of values
-the parent query's WHERE clause using the NOT IN operator skips deleting all those ROWID that the subquery returns
-since the subquery returns the lowest ROWID of every set of duplicate records, one record frome ach such set of duplicate records is retained
-Since oracle executes the subquery, prior to exeucting the parent SQL command, the parent query i,e the DELETE commadn is fired basedon the values retrieved by the subquery.
-In real time, when subquery is fired is fired the following records are held in the memory that are passed to the parent query.
-after subquery compelts its execution, oracle replaces the values in the parent query's WHERE clause with the lowest ROWID, thus delete command will be

DELETE FROM customer WHERE ROWID NOT IN ( .......... );



3) the ROWNUM Pseduo-columns
----------------------------
-it is useful to add sequence number of the output

4) the ROWSCN Pseduo-columns
----------------------------
-it gives the approximate System change Number(SCN) when the rows is last modified.
-SCN is the number generated by Oracle to record the sequence of transaction, when this transaction has been commited


5) the SYDATE Pseduo-columns
----------------------------
-it gives the current data and time of the system

6) the UID Pseduo-columns
-------------------------
-it gives a number that identifies the user, since oracle is used in a multiuser environment.
-in simple word identify the user of Oracle;

7) the USER Pseduo-columns
--------------------------
-it is used to retrieve the user name
