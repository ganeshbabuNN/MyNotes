Operator
========
-Some of the operations performed on the values are called operations
-An Operations is performed by using at least one symbol and one value. The Symbol usedin an operation is called an Operator.
A Value involved in an Operations is called an operand or an argument.
-Operators are used in expression or conditional statments

Some of the operator
1)Arithematic Operators
2)Logical operator
3)Comparison operators
4)Date Operator
4)LIKE Operator
5)in NAN and is infinite Operators
6)Operator Precedance

DUAL Work Table
===============
-there are times when some calculation need to performed on values which are not avaiable in a database table.
-In such arithematic calculations, tables are not referenced, only numberic values are used.


1)Arithematic Operators
-----------------------
-It is used to perform arithmetical calculations on a pair of values and or constants. 
-it can be applied whilst viewing records from a table or performing data manipulation operations such as insert,update and delete

Operator	Description
--------	-----------
+-		Positive or Negative expression
+		Addition
-		Subtraction
*		Multiplication
**		Exponentiation
/		Division
()		Enclosed Operations

2)Logical operator
------------------
-logical operator is used to test whether the result of a conditions is TRUE or FALSE. the result is always boolean value  i,e TRUE or FALSE

1)AND Operator
-this is used to fetch selected rows that satisfy all the given conditions
-this operators requires that each conditions must be met for record to be included in the result set.

2)OR Operator
-OR Operator is used to fetch selected rows that satisf at least one of the given conditions

3)NOT Operator
-Every condition that is evaluated by a set of logical operators can be negated to change the condition's perspective
-it determine the rows that do not satisfy a given conditions

4)Nested logical Operator
- THE NOT ,AND and OR Operator can be combined in a single SQL statment. 
-when using this operator , its imp to use round brackets to indicate the evaluations order.
-the Order in which are the conditions are pharsed is very important, if the order changes its likey to have a different results
-Since Both the operators are used together, it processes all rows in a table and displays the result only when
1)All of the conditions specified using the NOT operator are not met
2)All of the conditions specified using the AND operator are met
3)Any of the conditions specified using the OR operator are met

3)Comparison operators
----------------------
-Equality - =
-Inequality- !=,^=,<>
-Greater Than or Equal To & Less Than or Equal To- >=, <=
-Equal to Any member of - IN(compares the single value) , =ANY(compares all values)
-Not Equal to Any Member of - NOT IN , !=ANY
-Equal to any value in a list or returned by a query - ANY, SOME ( this operatore be preceded by =,!=,>,<,<=,>= operator)
-Equal To every value in a list or returned by a Query- ALL
-Exists - Exists
-Test NULL Values  -  IS[NOT]NULL
-BETWEEN Operator
--to determine whether a value of an expression falls within a specified range of values, the BETWEEN operator is used.
--This allows selecting rows that contain values within a specified lower and upper limit. the range specified after the word BETWEEN is inclusive
--the NOT operator can also be used with BETWEEN

4)Date Operator
---------------
Operator - + , -

4)LIKE Operator
---------------
- the LIKE operator allows comparing one string value with another string value, which is not identical.
-this is achieved by using WILDCARD characters
-- % Allows to match any string of any length [including zero length]
-- _ Allows to match a single character

Escape Character
- we can use the special characters such as % and _ which are used as wild characters with the LIKE operator
- Escaping these characters enables finding all those words that have % or _ within


5)in NAN and is infinite Operators
----------------------------------
- db 10 g provides two new operators to support the introduction of BINARY_FLOAT and BINARY_DOUBLE types
- it can hold values such as NaN and infinity , the following are made available to deal with them
-- IS NAN /IS NOT NAN : Matches NaN value
-- IS INFINITE / IS NOT INFINITE : Matches INFINTE value.


6)Operator Precedance
---------------------
-is the order in which oracle evaluates different operator is the same expression
-when evaluating an expression containing multiple operator.
-it evaluates operator with higher precedence before evaluate those with lower precedence.
-it evaluates operator with equal precedence from left to right within an expression
-Operator precedence plays a signifiant role of determinig the sequence in which, the opertions are performed in complex
expression, with multiple operators.

Order	Operator	Description
1	+  -		Positive or Negative Expression
2	* /		Mutliplication , Division
3	+ - ||		Addition, subtraction, concatenation
4	= != < > 	Comparion
	<= >= IS NULL
	LIKE BETWEEN
5	** NOT		Exponentiation, logical negation
6	AND		Logical AND
7	OR		Logical OR


Expression Operator
==================

1)UNION
2)INTERSECT
3)MINUS
