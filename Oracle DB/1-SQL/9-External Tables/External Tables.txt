Intro
=====
-These external table features allows using flat files which
*reside outside the database
*can be accessed just like relational tables within the db.
-it basically external tables are defined as a tables, that do not reside in the database and can be in any format for which an access driver is provided
-An external table can be thought of as a view that allows running any SQL Query against external data, without requiring that the external data first be loaded into the database.


Steps for Creating Table involves
1)Creting of Flat Files
2)Creationg of Directory object
3)Creations of an external table[Meta Data] within this directory


1)Creting of Flat Files
------------------------
-create a flat file with some format txt


2)Creationg of Directory object
-------------------------------
--the following syntax is used to create the ExternalTables directory object

syntax
------
CREATE OR REPLACE DIRECTORY ExtTables AS <DirectoryPath>;

Note:
- this is command can only be executed as SYS user or by a user wh has been granted the CREATE ANY DIRECTORY OBJECT
syntax
-------
grant CREATE ANY DIRECTORY to <userName>;



3)Creations of an external table[Meta Data] within this directory
-----------------------------------------------------------------

create table employeemaster(
<columnName1> <dataType1>,
<columnName2> <dataType2>,
<columnName3> <dataType3>,
--
--
--
ORGANIZATION EXTERNAL (
  TYPE ORACLE_LOADER
  DEFAULT DIRECTORY ExtTables
  ACCESS PARAMETERS(RECORDS DELIMITED BY NEWLINE
    FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' MISSING FIELD VALUES ARE NULL)
  LOCATION ('<externalTablefilename'))
REJECT LIMIT UNLIMITED;


-meta data creations
*the ORACLE_LOADER is an Access driver for the loading data from the external files into the tables
*the ACCESS PARAMETERS control the extraction of data from the flat files using record and file formatting information
*the RECORDS DELIMITED BY NEWLINE indicates each and every record in the file will appear on a new line
*the FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' indicates every column will be separated by a comma.
*Missing FIELD VALUES NULL Indicates columns having no value will be holding NULL.
*Externaltables is a directory where the external flat files resides
*the Directory is a non-schema object introduced by oracle that defines the path to an operating system directory
*the parameter specified are the same parameters that are used by the SQL*Loader utitlity

*Querying external tables;
-When we query the external table (ex:ganesh.txt)  the data retrieved from the external data files
-when the user selects data from the external data, the dataflow goes from the external data source to the Oracle SQL egnine, where data is processed
-The ORACLE_LOADER driver can be used to access any data stored in any format that can be loaded by SQL*LOADER.
-All DML Operations cannot be performed on external tables, but they can used for query , join and sort operations.
-View and synonyms can be created against external tables. they are useful in teh ETL process of data warehouses , since the data does not need to be staged and can be queried in parallel

limitations of external tables
=============================
-it does not describe any data that is stored in the database
-does not describe how data is stored in the external source. this is the function of the access parameters
-it is read-only source. insert operations cannot be performed into an external table nor can be the records be updated in a external table
-these table should not be used for frquently qu
eried tables.

Using Multiple FLat Files
==========================
- data can be spread across multiple text files as

for example
------------
ganesh.txt
ganesh1.txt

create table employeemaster(
<columnName1> <dataType1>,
<columnName2> <dataType2>,
<columnName3> <dataType3>,
--
--
--
ORGANIZATION EXTERNAL (
  TYPE ORACLE_LOADER
  DEFAULT DIRECTORY ExtTables
  ACCESS PARAMETERS(RECORDS DELIMITED BY NEWLINE
    FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' MISSING FIELD VALUES ARE NULL)
  LOCATION ('<externalTablefilename1>,<externalTablefilename2>'))
REJECT LIMIT UNLIMITED;

Creating Views on External tables
=================================


Populating tables based on data held by external tables
=======================================================
-Data from external files can be populated to some ther tables, using an INSERT INTO.. SELECT FROM Statement instead of using SQL*Loader. this method provides very fast data loads


Dropping the External Tables
===========================
-for extenral table, the DROP Table statement removes only the table metadata inthe database
-it does not effect on actual data, which resides outside of the database.

DROP TABLE <tablename>;
