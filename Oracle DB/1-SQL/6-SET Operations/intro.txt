SET
===

-A table can be defined as a relation i,e set of elements , therefore relational database all data is stored in the form of sets.
-A query returns a set of rwos , So you can do additional set operations on the output of the query.
-you can combine results of multiple queries using different set operations.
-the common set operations are UNION,MINUS and INTERSECT

Set Operations
-------------
1)UNION
2)INTERSECT
3)MINUS

UNION
=====
-Union allows putting together multiple queries and combines the output generated by those queries.
-it merges the output of two or more queries into a single set of rwos and columns
-Basically the output of the union clause is: records from query one+ Records from query two + A single of set of recrods, common in both queries.
-it displays only distinct values[such as [SELECT DISTINCT] and NULL values are not ignored during duplicate checking.

Syntax
------
SELECT <Column1>,.... <ColumnN> from <DerivedTable>
UNION[ALL]
SELECT <Column1>,.... <ColumnN> from <DerivedTable>

*ALL keyword is used along with UNION operator includes duplicated rows in the combined result sets.

Rules
-----
-the name of the columns need not be identical
-the width of columns can be different

In UNION Query
--------------
-Only Alaiases of the column of the first query are considered
-ORDER BY clause is the last clause after the last query
-subqueries cannot be used
-Aggregate functions cannot be used.


-The UNION clause picks up the common records as well as the individual records in both queries
-UNION ALL operator picks up all records as well as the individual records in both queries
-By Default the output is sorted in ascending order of the first column of the SELECT Clause
-Only the alias that is assigned to the first query will be applied in the final output irrespective of the alias assigned to the second query.

INTERSECT
=========
-Multiple queries can be put together and their output combined using the intersect clause.
-the INTERSECT clause output only rows produced by both the queries intersected i,e the output in an INTERSECT clause will include only those rows that are retrieved common to both the queries

Syntax
------
SELECT <Column1>,.... <ColumnN> from <DerivedTable>
INTERSECT
SELECT <Column1>,.... <ColumnN> from <DerivedTable>

MINUS
====
-Multiple queries can be put together and their output combined using the intersect clause.
-The MINUS clauses output the rows produced by the first query,after filtering the row retrieved by the second query

Syntax
------
SELECT <Column1>,.... <ColumnN> from <DerivedTable>
MINUS
SELECT <Column1>,.... <ColumnN> from <DerivedTable>


Some other SET Operations
========================
1)IN Cluase
2)EXISTS Clause
3)Multi column subqueries
4)self join
