Automatically generating and assigning Primary Key values
=========================================================
-In huge commerical applications, there are a lot of tables. Every tables holds a set of records which need to be uniquely identified.
-A Primary key helps achieving this. The Primary key is generated either by the applications or by the DB.
-To generate the PK using DB objects, a program need to be written. This program will automatically determine the next value and assign the same to the PK column of the desired tables.
-If a PK values is generated by DB objects, the INSERT INTO query that is fired by the applications not use the PK column in the columns listing, since the DB is going to assign that value.
-Using the DB objects, one of the following methods can be used to automatically generated and assign the PK value to the appropriate table.
1)Using a sequence to generate a PK value and a Trigger to assign the generated PK value
2)Using the MAX funciton to generate a PK value and a trigger to assign the generated PK value.
3)Using a lookup table to hold the next PK value and a trigger to assign the new PK value held by the lookup table and regenerate one, store it in the lookup table for the next inserts if any.


Generating PK Using Sequences
-----------------------------
-A Primary Key value being a running number can be generated using a combinations of a sequence and trigger
-The sequences will be responsible to generate the next value for that columns. The trigger is responsible to assign the next value generated by the sequences to the column when a record is being inserted;



Generating PK Using the MAX Function
------------------------------------
-A PK value is usally a running number which is highest value in the PK key column +1.
-Oracle allows fetching the highest value in the column using the MAX functions. 


Generating PK Using the A Lookup Table
--------------------------------------
-The combination of a lookup table to hold next value and a trigger to assign the next value can also achieve the same
-This lookup table will be a two column table. The first column holds the table name for which the PK is being generated and the second column holds the actual PK value. hence a single table can serve the primary key generation of several other tables in the DB.
-A Triggers is written to retrieve the value from the lookup table for a particular table. the value that is retrieved is assigned to the PK column whilst a record is inserted into that table.
