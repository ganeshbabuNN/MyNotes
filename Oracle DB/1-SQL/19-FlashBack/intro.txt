Intro
=====
-Most of the times an applications crashes only because of human errors
-A human errors could result in logical data corruptions due to which the applications can simply halt.

*-The most common errors that causes an application to go down are
1)Accidental deletions of valuable data
2)Deleting the wrong data
3)Dropping the wrong table
-it is extremely difficult to avoid such errors
-Oracle offers flash technology as a solutions in the area of databas recovery due to the human errors
-this technology allows viewing and rewinding data back and forth in time.
-Oracle 9i introduced the DBMS_FLASHbACK package to allows queries to reference older version of the DB
-Oracle 10g has taken this technology, a step further, making it simpler to use and much more flexiable.
-A Flashback allows reverting mistakenly committed changes by viewing the orginal records before the COMMIT was executed. if required, the results of query flashback can be used to manaually change rows backs to their orginal values
-Flashbacks can be based on a datatime or System Change Number[SCN].The DB uses SCNs to track chanes made to data and these can be used to flash back to a particular SCN in the DB.
-Ensure the EXECUTE privilege exists on the PL/SQL's DBMS_FLASHBACK Package which is required to proceed with FlashBack

sytnax
	CONNECT SYS/<Password for sys> AS SYSDBA
	GRANT EXECUTE ON SYS.DBMS_FLASHBACK To <SchemaName>;

The Time Query FlashBacks
=========================	
-The DBMS_FLASHBACK.ENABLE_AT_TIME() procedures performs a flashback to a particular data
-this procedures accepts a datatime as a parameter. SYSDATE -2 is passed to the procedures which means two days back.
-Any queries executed after performing such flashback will display the rows as they were 2 days back

EXECUTE DBMS_FLASHBACK.ENABLE_AT_TIME(SYSDATE-2);

-Flashback should be disabled before it can be enabled again.
-After the flashback is disabled, the queries fired will retrieve the current data.

The System Change Number(SCN) Query FlashBacks
=========================================
-Flashbacks based on SCN are more precise than those based on a time
-To use flashback on the basis of SCN, the current SCN needs to be extracted . To do so, execute DBMS_FLASHBACK.GET_SYSTEM_CHANGE_NUMBER();

VARIABLE CurrentSCN NUMBER
EXECUTE :CurrentSCN := DBMS_FLASHBACK.GET_SYSTEM_CHANGE_NUMBER();

--A flashback should be disabled before it can enabled again.

FlashBack Table
===============
-Oracle flashback features also allows recovering an accidently deleted table
-Suppose a user has accidentally deleted a table called Students;
	DROP TABLE Students;
-On Such deletions, oracle moves it to the recycle bin rather than actually deleting it.
-A Recycle bins is a logical collections of prevously dropped objects, the contents of the recycle bin can be viewed, using the SHOW RECYCLEBIN command and purged, using the PURGE TABLE Command.
-Oracle maintains a recycle bin very similar to an operating system. to view the contents of the recycle bins issues the following command;
	SHOW RECYCLEBIN;

-to view those table which is recyclebin, put with double quotes
select * from "BIN$OISgM7cRQ1y8fhGmfosaig==$0";
*-the tble nameis sepcified with double quotes. this is because of several special characters such as $,=,/ and so on exists in the table name which could prevent succesful executions of command as show below.

-to recover back the tabe from recycle bin
FLASHBACK TABLE <TableName> TO BEFORE DROP

-A table can be restored with a new name
FLASHBACK TABLE <TableName> TO BEFORE DROP RENAME TO <NewTableName>;

-to delete content in Recycle bin
PURGE RECYCLEBIN;
-When a table is deleted by a users, oracle renames it to system defined name that beings with BIN$.it does not delete the table
-if an object is dropped and recreated multiple times, all the dropped versions are kept in the recycle bin, subject to availablity of space
-the flashback table features is intelligent enough to be able to manage multiple stored copies of the same table, if the table dropped and recreated with different structure. it also purges old copies of recycled tables if the DB starts to run short of space
-The table can be dropped without being sent to the Recycle Bin. To do so, issue the following command
	DROP TABLE <TableName> PURGE;
-this is similar to using SHIFT+DEL key in windows


Enabling and Disabling Recycle Bin
==================================
-The Recycle bin can be enabled or disabled using the recycle bin initialization parameter
-By Default the recycle bin is enabled
-With the Recycle bin enabled, the dropped tables and their dependent objects are placed in recycle bin
-With the recycle bin disabled, the dropped tables and their dependent objects are not placed in the recycle in, they are permanently dropped.
-
Disabling the recycle bin does not purge or otherwise affect objects already in the recycle bin.
