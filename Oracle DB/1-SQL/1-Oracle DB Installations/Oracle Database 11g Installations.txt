Installation of Oracle DB 11g in linux/windows
=================================================
Note: for windows start with Step 11
Step 1-Ensure a full Qualified server name in the host file i,e /etc/hosts file must contain a fully qualified name for the server as shown in diagram
	<IP-Address> <Fully-qualified-machine-name> <machine-name>
Step 2- Setting kernal parmeters, oracle recommends the following minimum parameters values

Parameter Name-Value
Kernel.shmal-2097152
kernel.shmmax-2147483648
kernel.shmmni-4096
kernel.sem-250 32000 100 128
fs.file-max-65536
net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range-1024 65000
net.core.rmem_default-4194304
net.core.rmem_max-4194304
net.core.wmem_default-262144
net.core.wmem_max-262114
-*the currenc values can be fetched using the following command 
	/sbin/sysctl -a | grep <param-name>
-*kernal parameters having values greater than or equal to the onces listed in the table above should be left unaltered.to meet this requirement specification, the /etc/sysctl.conf file needs to be altered.this fileis primarily used during the boot process.

-* i shall discuss on RHEL editions.
-**Opend the /etc/sysctl.conf file in the text editor and enter the following lines as shown in 

For RHEL 4.5
************
Kernel.shmal-2097152
kernel.shmmax-2147483648
kernel.shmmni-4096
kernel.sem-250 32000 100 128
fs.file-max-65536
net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range-1024 65000
net.core.rmem_default-4194304
net.core.rmem_max-4194304
net.core.wmem_default-262144
net.core.wmem_max-262114

For RHEL linux 5.0
************
kernel.shmmni-4096
kernel.sem-250 32000 100 128
fs.file-max-65536
net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range-1024 65000
net.core.rmem_default-4194304
net.core.rmem_max-4194304
net.core.wmem_default-262144
net.core.wmem_max-262114

Step 3-Applying the change made to kernal parameters
these modification in the sysctl file, causes the system to change the kernel parameters after each boot so as to make the system compatible for runing Oracle 11g. For these change to be effective immediately execute the following command as follows
	/sbin/sysctl -p

Step 4-Setting file descriptor limits
Linux limits the number of file descriptors that any one process may open. The default limits are 1024 per process. these limits can prvent optimum performance. to increate the number of ifle descriptors for the Oracle user's process, add the following lines to the /etc/security/limits.conf file 

Step 5 -Setting Login module in Pluggable authentication modules[PAM]
Add the following line to the /etc/pam.d/login file, if it does not already exist as shown file . this will invoek these modules.

Step 6 -Disabliing security-Enabled linux[SELinux]
-Disable the security -enchanged linux[SELinux] module by editing the /etc/selinux/config file, making sure the SELINUX flag is set as follows as shown
	 SELINUX=Disabled
-Disabling SELINUX prevents any permissions issues, whilst installing oracle DB.
-Alternatively it can be done using the GUI tool[Applications->system settings -> security Level]. Click the SELinux table and disable the features.

step 7-Meeting the package requirements
-to install oracle, certain linux package are required, if these are not available, install them.

step 8-Creating the Oracle User Accounts
-to install oracle, appropriate user and groups need to be created , using which Oracle will be installed.
-The new Users/Groups that have to be created are:
*User: ganesh[Provide any password of choice]
*Group : oinstall and dba
-Create the groups and users using the following command as shown
groupadd to oinstall
gropuadd dba
useradd -g oinstall -G dba Oracle
passwd ganesh
-Passwd command prompts for a password and its confirmation key . Key in an appropriate password and continue.

step 9-Creating Oracle Directories
-To install Oracle DB 11g, the following directory structure need to be created
	mkdir -p /u01/app/oracle/product/11.1.10/db_1
-Change the owner and group of directories create to oracle and oinstall respectively as 
	chown -R oracle:oinstall /u01
	chown -R 775/u01

Step10: 
Setting Oracle enviroment
-------------------------
-Disabling access control :- the xhost command needs to be executed. this is done to disable the access control mechanism of system. Login as root and issue the following command
	xhost+
-Doing so allows allows the clients to connect from any host. This is requiredto initiate the oracle installer

Adding Startup Entries
-loging as the oracle user and add the following lines at the end of the .bashrc files ..
TMP= /tmp;
export TMP
TMPDIR =$TMP;
export TMPDIR

ORACLE_HOSTNAME=oracle.orchid;
export ORACLE_HOSTNAME
ORACLE_BASE=/u01/app/oracle;
export ORACLE_BASE
ORACLE_HOME=$ORACLE_BASE/product/11.1.0/db_1;
export ORACLE_HOME
ORACLE_SID=orcl;
export ORACLE_SID
ORACLE_TERM=xterm;
export ORACLE_TERM
PATH=/usr/sbin:$PATH;
export PATH
PATH =$ORACLE_HOME/bin:$PATH;
export PATH

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/lib:/lib:/usr/lib;
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
CLASSPATH=$ORACLE_HOME/JRE:$ORACLE_HOME/jlib:$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/jlib;
export CLASSPATH
if[ $USER ='oracle"]; then
	if[ $SHELL = "/bin/ksh"}; then
	 ulimit -p 16384
	 ulimit -n 65536
 else
	ulimit -u 16384 -n -65536
  fi
fi



-the .bashrc file will be available inthe user's home directory. in this case it will be /home/oracle/.bashrc. After the file is edited, logout as the user oracle and login again, for the changes to take effect.

Step 11: Initiating the Oracle installer
-Locate the runinstaller script from source setup files and execute it, 
-if permission issue[Such as permission deined errors] are encountered whilst initiating the Oracle installer, ensure the execution permissions exist on the following files in the source;
*RunInstaller
*install/.oui
*install/unzip
-Set the execute permission for these files as:
	chmod 777 runinstaller
	chmod 777 install/.oui
	chmod 777 install/unzip
-Invoke setup.exe on windows or runinstall.sh on linux invokes a console window 
-Select Installation method --> this windows verfies the system requirements and if all is met, initiates and bring up the screen 
Basic installation : performs full Oracle 11g installations with standard configurations options requing minimal iput
Advance installation : allows advanced selections such as different passwords for the SYS,SYSTEM,SYSMAN and DBSNMP accounts, DB character set, product languages, automated backups, custom installations and alternative storage options such as Automatic storage management
-The basics installation options, the following informations is required
*Oracle Base location
*Oracle Home location
*An option to create a starter DB
*Global DB Name
*A common password for users such as SYS,SYSTEM,SYSMAN and DBSNMP
-The Oracle Base/Home location can be changed as desired.
-After Global DB name click Next to continue.
-**Next Step only for linux, 
-Specifyinventory directory and credentials -this script prompts for the inventory directory path. 
-The installer automatically sets up subdirectories for each product to contain inventory data.
-set the locations as /u01/app/orainventory [if found different] in the enter the full path of the inventory directory textbox . select the options oinstall from the specify OS group name list . click Next
--**Only for windows
-A progress bar is depicts the loading progress of the installation process
-Product-Specific pre-requisties checks... this installer verifies product-specific pre-requesites to ensure that all the environment requirements are met, After ensuring that all requirement are met, the installer brings up the oracle configurations manager registrations screen 
-Oracle configurations Manager registrations --> it allows associating configurations,informations with the users metalink account account. Enable the oracle configurations manager, if the configurations needs to be associated with the metalink.This is optional and hence can be skipped.
-Installation Summary- Click next
-- Click install, to start the actual transfer of files to their desinations on the computer HDD.
--COnfigurations assistants, after the copying of files to their destination is complete, the installation process automatically proceeds to configurations of all installed tools. It configures follows tools One is Oracle Net configurations Assistant and Oracle DB assistant
-Database configurations Assitant - While the Oracle DB configurations Assistant is being configured, a dialog box as .. the dialog box indicates the progress of the actual DB creations. this process is responsible for the actual DB creations
-DB configurations Asistant Summary- Once the completes, a screen displaying a summary and an options to start the password management tool .
-Unlok the User scott- Click password management, to unlock the SCOTT user account by removing the tick mark as, Click OK to go back to the screen , Here click ok and Click Next
-****For Linux -Exection Configurations Scripts - if this installation is being carried out on a linux machine, then an additional screen appears that indicates running orainstRoot.sh and root.sh at the root user..
-Open a terminal window and type following command at the commadn as shownin diagram
	su -
	<enter the root password>
	/u01/app/orainventory/orainstRoot.sh

	exit
-Switch back to universal installer
-ENd of the installation - thats end the successfull installation, A message for same appears as in windows and linux
-This windows informs the following:
*The place where the database has been installed
URL for the following
*Enterprise management database control
http://ganesh:1158/em
Note down this URL to invoke enterprise manager DB control when required.
-Click Exit, this will display a confirmations dialog box to exit the isntallations tool and click Yes to end the installations.

Oracle Enterprise Management DataBase Control
=============================================
-the oracle EM DB controls allows configuring service names, listeners, user and so on.
-Access it by pointing the web browser to..
http://<machinename>:1158/em
-Login using SYSTEM as the user name, provide the password specifided earlier whilst installing oracle and select normal in the connect as dropdown list-box .
-For now, close the enterprise manager window

Testing the installation 
=========================

in Windows
----------
-Activating/decactiving the Oracle DB service
-On windows based O/s, when oracle is installed, following services are created
1)Oracle DB
2)Listener
3)DB Console
-All these there services by default are set to startup automatically[i,e when the computer is switched on].Automatic startup causes computer resources[i,e memory] to be occupied by these services, even though they may not be in use.This adds to the load on the computers CPU and affects performance
-To avoid such resource blockage, the automatic start up of Oracle services can be set  to manual.
-Services that are set to manual can be started on demand when required

Switching automatic startup to manual startup in windows
--------------------------------------------------------
-To switch the mode of Oracle services from automatic to manual.
-Select Start-> Administrative tools-> Servies.
-Scroll through list of available services and locate the above mentioned services that belong to oracle
-Right click the first service, select Properties to get dialog box 
-IN the properties dialog box, set the startup type of manual and click Apply. This change the startup property of the select service to manual
-In the service status section, click STOP. the service shuts down with a progress bar that indicates the progress of shutdown
-After the service is stopped, close the properties dialog box, the status for that service appears as blank.
-Follow the same steps for the remaining services

Manually starting the oracle services on demand in windows
----------------------------------------------------------
-To access the Oracle DB, it is necessary to have the oracle DB server running. it is only when the following services are running will Oracle resources such as tables and views and so on be accessible:
a)Listener services
b)DB services
-Click Start--> administrative tools-> services
-Scroll though the list of available services and locate the above mentioned services that are required to run Oracle
-Right click the first service and click start. this will start the service.This will be indicated by a progress bar .Follow the same for other services
-After these services are started,they continue to run in memory as long as they are not manually stopped or the computer is switched off.

Starting and stopping the DB on linux
=====================================
-the easiest way to start and stop the DB is from command windows
Starting the DB
---------------
-The start the DB instance from the command line, while logged in as oracle, issue the following command
	dbstart
-After the DB starts, invoke SQL plus as follows
	sqlplus

Stopping the DB
---------------
-To stop the DB instance from the command line, while logged in as oracle, issue the following command
	bdshut
-if whilst starting or shutting down an error appears that indicates
	ORACLE_HOME_LISTENER NOT SET
-edit the /u01/app/oracle/product/11.1.0/db_1/bin/dbstart file and modify
	ORACLE_HOME_LISTENER=$1
-To
	ORACLE_HOME_LISTENER=$ORACLE_HOME
Similary ,edit the /u01/app/oracle/product/11.1.0/db_1/bin/dbshut file and perform the same modification
-this will resolve the issues

Automatically starting Oracle service on Linux
==============================================
-Oracle recommends configuring the OS to automatically start Oracle DB when the system starts up and to automatically shut it down when the system shuts down.
-AUtomating DB startup and shutdown helps guard against incorrect DB shutdown
-On Windows, automatic services are created by the installer, due to which the Oracle DB instance and the associated listener service start automatically on sytem startup
-However, on linux based system such a service is not created by the installer, it need to be created manually

Setting the Restart flag for each instance
------------------------------------------
-Oracle could be serving more then one DB.
-to start every DB instance on the system startup, edit /etc/oratb file to set the restart flag for each instance to Y as show
	orcl:/u01/app/oracle/product/11.1.0/db_1:Y

Creating the automatica startup script
--------------------------------------
login as the root user and create the file named /etc/init.d/dbora with the following contents

ORA_HOME=/u01/app/oracle/product/11.1.0/db_1
ORA_OWNER=oracle

if[!-f $ORA_HOME/bin/dbstart]
then
	echo "Oracle startup: cannot start"
	exit
fi

	case "$1"in 'start');; 'stop');;
esac

setting the startup scripts's permissions
-----------------------------------------
Issue the following command to set the file permissions to 750
	chgrp dba /etc/init.d/dbora
	chmod 750 /etc/init.d/dbora

Associating the service to run level
------------------------------------
-Associate the dbora service with the appropriate run level and set it to auto-start using the following command
	chkconfig --level 345 dbora on
-This command ensures that all the relvant DB instances startup and shutdown automatically at system startup and shutdown
-Now the oracle DB has become a service and therefore can be started and stopped as
-To start as shown 
 service dbora start
-To shutdown
	service dbora stop

Installation of Oracle 11g on a client machine
==============================================
