Different concepts on all type of R data type with example (this has already explained)

==============================
##only for concepts
Act as an expert instructor and industry practitioner.

Topic: <SPECIFIC TOPIC NAME>  
Level: Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced  
Audience: Learners who want strong conceptual clarity and real-world application  

Objective:
Provide a complete learning module for <SPECIFIC TOPIC NAME>.

TASKS:

1️.CONCEPT COVERAGE
- Identify and list **ALL important concepts** related to <SPECIFIC TOPIC NAME>
- Organize them logically:
  - Beginner
  - Intermediate
  - Advanced
- Do NOT skip any commonly used real-world concept

2️.CONCEPT EXPLANATION (For EACH concept)
Include:
a. Definition (simple and clear)
b. Purpose / Why it is used
c. Syntax or structure (if applicable)
d. One **basic example**
e. One **real-world / practical example**
f. Common mistakes
g. Best practices
h. When to use vs when NOT to use

3️.REAL-WORLD MAPPING
- Provide a table mapping:
  Concept | Real-world use case | Industry example

4️.PRACTICAL INSIGHTS
- Performance considerations (if applicable)
- Common pitfalls seen in real projects
- Scalability or maintainability notes (if relevant)

5️.FINAL SUMMARY
- Key takeaways
- Learning roadmap (what to study next)
- Recommended practice strategy

FORMATTING RULES:
- Use clear headings and subheadings
- Use bullet points for explanations
- Use code blocks where needed
- Keep explanations concise but complete

=====================================================================
## for assignment
Act as an expert instructor and problem designer.

Topic: <SPECIFIC TOPIC NAME>  
Level: Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced  
Audience: Learners practicing concepts through real-world scenarios  

Objective:
Create concept-wise assignments for <SPECIFIC TOPIC NAME>.

TASKS:

1️.CONCEPT IDENTIFICATION
- Identify and list **ALL important concepts** related to <SPECIFIC TOPIC NAME>
- Organize them logically:
  - Beginner
  - Intermediate
  - Advanced
- Do NOT skip any commonly used real-world concept

2️.ASSIGNMENT CREATION (For EACH concept)
For every concept, create **1–2 real-world problem statements**.

Each assignment MUST strictly follow this structure:

**Problem Title**  
(A short, descriptive real-world title)

**Input**  
- Clearly specify:
  - Input variables
  - Data types
  - Constraints (if any)

**Scenario**  
- Describe the real-world situation step by step
- Clearly mention:
  - Initial values
  - Conditions
  - Rules or logic to be applied
- Avoid giving code
- Keep the logic explicit and unambiguous

**Output**  
- Clearly specify:
  - What should be printed or returned
  - Format of the output
  - Expected result description

3.DIFFICULTY PROGRESSION
- Beginner: Simple logic, minimal conditions
- Intermediate: Multiple conditions, combinations, calculations
- Advanced: Edge cases, validations, performance or scalability considerations

4️.RULES
- Do NOT provide solutions or code
- Do NOT include quizzes or theory
- Keep problems practical and relatable (billing, login systems, sensors, reports, workflows, etc.)
- Each problem should map clearly to ONE core concept

FORMATTING RULES:
- Use clear headings
- Follow the exact structure: Title → Input → Scenario → Output
- Keep language simple and precise
