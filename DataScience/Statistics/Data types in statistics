=====
-Data Types are an important concept of statistics, which needs to be understood, to correctly apply statistical measurements to your data and 
therefore to correctly conclude certain assumptions about it.
-Having a good understanding of the different data types, also called measurement scales, is a crucial prerequisite for doing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), 
since you can use certain statistical measurements only for specific data types
-You also need to know which data type you are dealing with to choose the right visualization method. Think of data types as a way to categorize different types of variables

Introduction to Data Types
==========================
There are two types of data
1)Numerical (Quatitative)
2)Categorical (Qualitative)

Numerical -->  Discreate Data and Continuous Data ( in the raw data perpestive)
             Interval and Ratio data ( in terms of analysis perpestive which is part of Continuous Data)
Categorical --> nominal and ordinal data

Categorical Data
=================
-Categorical data represents characteristics
-Therefore it can represent things like a person’s gender, language etc
-Categorical data can also take on numerical values (Example: 1 for female and 0 for male). Note that those numbers don’t have mathematical meaning

Nominal Data
------------
-Nominal values represent discrete units and are used to label variables,
-Note that nominal data that has no order i,e if you would change the order of its values, the meaning would not change

ex:
1)Are you married ? Yes or No
2)What language you speak ? english, kannada,french,German
3)Hair colour ? black,yellow
4)Ethicinty ? Asian ,Hispanic

Ordinal Data
------------
-Ordinal values represent discrete and ordered units.
-It is therefore nearly the same as nominal data, except that it’s ordering matters.

ex:
1)educations background ? 1-Elementary ,2-High School ,3-Undergradudate,4-Gradidate
2)customer servity ? High, Medium, Low
3)First , Second and Third
4)Letter grades? A, B, C
5)Economic Status? Low,medium

-This is the main limitation of ordinal data the differences between the values is not really known. 
-Because of that, ordinal scales are usually used to measure non-numeric features like happiness, customer satisfaction and so on

Numerical Data
==============

Discrete Data
-------------
-The discrete data if the data can only take on certain values. This type of data can’t be measured but it can be counted.
-It basically represents information that can be categorized into a classification
-You can check by asking the following two questions whether you are dealing with discrete data or not: 
  --Can you count it and can it be divided up into smaller and smaller parts?

Ex:
-is the number of heads in 100 coin flips.
-The number of students in the class
-the number of workers in a company
-The number of home runs in baseball game.

Continuous Data
---------------
-Continuous Data represents measurements and therefore their values can’t be counted but they can be measured.

Ex:
-would be the height of a person, which you can describe by using intervals on the real number lin
-The square of the footage of two -bedroom house
-the speed of a car
-the height of a childern

Interval Data
*-----------*
-Interval values represent ordered units that have the same difference
-Interval data when we have a variable that contains numeric values that are ordered and where we know the exact differences between the values.

ex:
-Temperature : -10,3,49,34,54,23,56,23,45

-The problem with interval values data is that they don’t have a "true zero".
-That means in regards to our example, that there is no such thing as no temperature. With interval data, we can add and subtract, 
but we cannot multiply, divide or calculate ratios. Because there is no true zero, a lot of descriptive and inferential statistics can’t be applied

Ratio Data
*---------*
-Ratio values are also ordered units that have the same difference. 
-Ratio values are the same as interval values, with the difference that they do have an absolute zero

ex:
length: 0,10,15,20

Why Data Types are important
============================
-Datatypes are an important concept because statistical methods can only be used with certain data types
-You have to analyze continuous data differently than categorical data otherwise it would result in a wrong analysis. 
-We will now go over every data type again but this time in regards to what statistical methods can be applied

Nominal Data
------------
When you are dealing with nominal data, you collect information through:

Frequencies: The Frequency is the rate at which something occurs over a period of time or within a dataset.
Proportion: You can easily calculate the proportion by dividing the frequency by the total number of events. (e.g how often something happened divided by how often it could happen)
Percentage.
Visualisation Methods: To visualise nominal data you can use a pie chart or a bar chart.


Ordinal Data
-------------
When you are dealing with ordinal data, you can use the same methods like with nominal data, but you also have access to some additional tools. 
Therefore you can summarise your ordinal data with frequencies, proportions, percentages. 
And you can visualise it with pie and bar charts. Additionally, you can use percentiles, median, mode and the interquartile range to summarise your data.
In Data Science, you can use one label encoding, to transform ordinal data into a numeric feature.

Continuous Data
---------------
-When you are dealing with continuous data, you can use the most methods to describe your data.
-You can summarise your data using percentiles, median, interquartile range, mean, mode, standard deviation, and range.

Visualisation Methods:
-To visualise continuous data, you can use a histogram or a box-plot. 
With a histogram, you can check the central tendency, variability, modality, and kurtosis of a distribution. 
Note that a histogram can’t show you if you have any outliers. This is why we also use box-plots.
