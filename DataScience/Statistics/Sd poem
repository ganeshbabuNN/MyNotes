standard deviation poem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You're taking a good step from me,
I'm just an average, you see.
You're taking a good step from me,
squared paths in between.

It's all adding up,
It is all adding up,
It is all adding up,
Eventually

I feel divided by your group,
You're bunch of nifty squares,
but I'm feeling no good.
I'm taking squared roots
to make a quick flee

Call me whatever you feel
Call me whatever you feel
Call me whatever you feel
But standard deviation preferablyâ€¦
