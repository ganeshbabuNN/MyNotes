Unzipping and Zipping Files
===========================
As you are probably aware, files can be compressed to a zip format. 
Often people use special programs on their computer to unzip these files, luckily for us, 
Python can do the same task with just a few simple lines of code.

Create Files to Compress
========================
# slashes may need to change for MacOS or Linux
f1=open("newfile.txt","w+")
f1.write("hello newfile1")
f1.close()

# slashes may need to change for MacOS or Linux
f2=open("newfile1.txt","w+")
f2.write("hello newfile2")
f2.close()

Zipping Files
=============
The zipfile library is built in to Python, we can use it to compress folders or files. 
To compress all files in a folder, just use the os.walk() method to iterate this process for all the files in a directory

import zipfile
#Create Zip file first , then write to it (the write step compresses the files.)
compfile=zipfile.ZipFile('compfile.zip','w')
compfile.write("newfile1.txt",compress_type=zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED)
compfile.write("newfile2.txt",compress_type=zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED)
compfile.close()

Extracting from Zip Files
=========================
We can easily extract files with either the extractall() method to get all the files, or just using the extract() method to only grab individual files.

zip_obj=zipfile.ZipFile("compfile.zip",'r')
zip_obj.extractall("extracted_content")

Using shutil library
====================
Often you don't want to extract or archive individual files from a .zip, but instead archive everything at once. The shutil library that is built in to python has easy to use commands for this:

import shutil

The shutil library can accept a format parameter, format is the archive format: one of "zip", "tar", "gztar", "bztar", or "xztar".

directory_zip=r"C:\GBAG_Back\MyTraining\Python\4-API"
output_filename = 'example'

import shutil
directory_zip=r"C:\GBAG_Back\MyTraining\Python\4-API"
output_filename = 'exampl1e'
# Just fill in the output_filename and the directory to zip
# Note this won't run as is because the variable are undefined
shutil.make_archive(output_filename,'zip',directory_zip,)

# Extracting a zip archive
# Notice how the parameter/argument order is slightly different here
dir_for_extract_result=r'C:\GBAG_Back\MyTraining\Python\4-API'
shutil.unpack_archive(output_filename,dir_for_extract_result,'zip')
