Math
===
Python comes with a built in math module and random module. 
In this lecture we will give a brief tour of their capabilities. 
Usually you can simply look up the function call you are looking for in the online documentation.

min and max
------------
The min() and max() functions can be used to find the lowest or highest value in an iterable:

x= min(5,10,12)
y=max(4,2,2,33)
print(x)
print(y)

abs()
----
The abs() function returns the absolute (positive) value of the specified number:

abs(-20)

pow
---
The pow(x, y) function returns the value of x to the power of y (xy).

x=pow(4,3)
print(x)
