Files
=====
If you want to write the data into a file, you use file handling.

syntax
file object = open(<file-name>, <access-mode>, <buffering>)  

access-mode
r -It opens the file to read-only. The file pointer exists at the beginning.
rb -It opens the file to read only in binary format. The file pointer exists at the beginning of the file.
r+ -It opens the file to read and write both. The file pointer exists at the beginning of the file.
rb+ -It opens the file to read and write both in binary format. The file pointer exists at the beginning of the file.
w - It opens the file to write only. It overwrites the file if previously exists or creates a new one if no file exists with the same name. The file pointer exists at the beginning of the file.
wb - It opens the file to write only in binary format. It overwrites the file if it exists previously or creates a new one if no file exists with the same name. The file pointer exists at the beginning of the file.
w+ - It opens the file to write and read both. It is different from r+ in the sense that it overwrites the previous file if one exists whereas r+ doesn't overwrite the previously written file. It creates a new file if no file exists. The file pointer exists at the beginning of the file.
wb+- It opens the file to write and read both in binary format. The file pointer exists at the beginning of the file.
a - It opens the file in the append mode. The file pointer exists at the end of the previously written file if exists any. It creates a new file if no file exists with the same name.
ab - It opens the file in the append mode in binary format. The pointer exists at the end of the previously written file. It creates a new file in binary format if no file exists with the same name.
a+ - It opens a file to append and read both. The file pointer remains at the end of the file if a file exists. It creates a new file if no file exists with the same name.
ab+- It opens a file to append and read both in binary format. The file pointer remains at the end of the file.


Write String to a file
----------------------

f=open("mylog.txt","w")
f.write("Hello, gani how are you")
f.close()

Read from a file
----------------
f=open("mylog.txt","r")
c=f.read()
print(c)
f.close()

Write multiple strings
----------------------
f=open("newfile.txt","w")
print("Enter Text(Type # when your are done)")
s=""
while s!="#":
    s=input()
    f.write(s + "\n")
f.close()

#another method to write line by line
f.writelines(s)


Pickle
------
--Pickle is used for serializing and de-serializing Python object structures, also called marshalling or flattening. 
--Serialization refers to the process of converting an object in memory to a byte stream that can be stored on disk or sent over a network. 
Later on, this character stream can then be retrieved and de-serialized back to a Python object. 

class Student:
    def __init__(self,id,name,score):
        self.id=id
        self.name=name
        self.score=score
        
    def display(self):
        return print(self.id,self.name,self.score)


serialize the object
*-------------------*

import pickle,studentpick

f=open("student.bat","wb")
s=studentpick.Student(12,"ganesh",69)
pickle.dump(s,f)
f.close()


Unpickle
*-------*
-its usually de-serialize the object from the already serialized object

import pickle
f=open("student.bat","rb")
obj=pickle.load(f)
obj.display()
f.close()

OS Module
========
Python has a built-in os module that allows us to use operating system dependent functionality.

Getting Directories
-------------------
You can get the current directory

import os
os.getcwd()

or using pwd(in notebook only)

Listing Files in a Directory
------------------------------

os.listdir() # In your current directory

os.listdir("C:\\Users") #In any directory you pass

Check if the file exists
-----------------------
import os,sys

s="mylog.txt"
if os.path.isfile(s):
    print("file exists")
else:
    print("File does not exists")
    sys.exit

f=open(s,'r')
con=f.read()
print(con)

Walking through a directory
---------------------------
Often you will just need to "walk" through a directory, that is visit every file or folder and check to see if a file is in the directory, and then perhaps do something with that file. 
Usually recursively walking through every file and folder in a directory would be quite tricky to program, but luckily the os module has a direct method call for this called os.walk().

for folder , sub_folders , files in os.walk("Example_Top_Level"):
    
    print("Currently looking at folder: "+ folder)
    print('\n')
    print("THE SUBFOLDERS ARE: ")
    for sub_fold in sub_folders:
        print("\t Subfolder: "+sub_fold )
    
    print('\n')
    
    print("THE FILES ARE: ")
    for f in files:
        print("\t File: "+f)
    print('\n')


walking to the directories path,dirname and file name
------------------------------------------------------
for path,dirname,file in os.walk(os.getcwd()):
    print("path: ",path)
    print("dirname: ",dirname)
    print("file: ",file)

Deleting the file
------------------

os.unlink(r"C:\Users\gbag\Desktop\internet\ds\sep 2020.pdf")  #which deletes a file at the path your provide
os.rmdir(r"C:\Users\gbag\Desktop\internet\ds") #which deletes a folder (folder must be empty) at the path your provide

send2Trash
==========
-this is external package
-this will send to the trash instead of permanent removeal
pip install send2trash

send2trash.send2trash('new.txt')

shutil.rmtree
*-----------*
-this is the most dangerous, as it will remove all files and folders contained in the path.
**All of these methods can not be reversed! Which means if you make a mistake you won't be able to recover the file. Instead we will use the send2trash module. 
-A safer alternative that sends deleted files to the trash bin instead of permanent removal.**
shutil.rmtree(r"C:\Users\gbag\Desktop\internet\ds")  #send2trash module. A safer alternative that sends deleted files to the trash bin instead of permanent removal.

shutil Module
=============
The shutil module offers a number of high-level operations on files and collections of file
In particular, functions are provided which support file copying and remova
You can use the built-in shutil module to to move files to different locations. 
Keep in mind, there are permission restrictions, for example if you are logged in a User A, you won't be able to make changes to the top level Users folder without the proper permissions

Copying the file
----------------
import shutil
shutil.copy(r'C:\GBAG_Back\MyTraining\Python\4-API\File Handling\Files Handling.txt',r'C:\GBAG_Back\MyTraining\Python\4-API\File Handling\New folder')

Moving the file
---------------
shutil.copy(r'C:\GBAG_Back\MyTraining\Python\4-API\File Handling\Files Handling.txt',r'C:\GBAG_Back\MyTraining\Python\4-API\File Handling\New folder')
