Intro
=====
-Comments are very important while writing a program. They describe what is going on inside a program, so that a person looking at the source code does not have a hard time figuring it out.
-this are ignore by the intrepreter


Types of comments
=================
there are three types
1)single line comment
2)multi line comment
3)docstrings

single line comment
-------------------
we use the hash (#) symbol to start writing a comment
Ex:
#print hello
print('Hello')

Multi-line comment
------------------
-We can have comments that extend up to multiple lines.One way is to use the hash(#) symbol at the beginning of each line

#This is a long comment
#and it extends
#to multiple lines

-Other way of doing this is to use triple quotes, either ''' or """. 
These triple quotes are generally used for multi-line strings.

"""This is also a
perfect example of
multi-line comments"""

how to write a better comments
==============================
-Use comments to describe what a function does and not the specific details on how the function does it.
-Try to remove as many redundant comments as possible. Try writing code that can explain itself, using better function/variable name choice.
-Try to make the comments as short and concise as possible

Docstrings in Python
--------------------
-A docstring is short for documentation string.
-Python docstrings (documentation strings) are the string literals that appear right after the definition of a function, method, class, or module.

def double(num):
    """Function to double the value"""
    return 2*num

-The docstrings are associated with the object as their __doc__ attribute.
print(double.__doc__)
