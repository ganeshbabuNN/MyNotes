Introduction
Delecration of Constants
Assigning values to Constants
Rules and Naming Convention for Constants

Introduction
============
-A constant is a type of variable whose value cannot be changed
-You can think of constants as a bag to store some books which cannot be replaced once placed inside the bag
-In reality, we don't use constants in Python. Naming them in all capital letters is a convention to separate them from variables, however, it does not actually prevent reassignment

Delecration of variables
=========================
-In really there is no such called constants in python, but in case if we want to use, lets take the below example.

Assigning values to variable
=============================
constants.py
	PI=31.42
	SQRTA= 32.

testconstants.py
	import constants
	print(constants.PI)
	print(constants.SQRTA)
	
Rules and Naming Convention for Constants
========================================
1)Use capital letters possible to declare a constant. For example:
	PI
	G
	MASS
	SPEED_OF_LIGHT
	TEMP
its same as the variables , Refers the variables
