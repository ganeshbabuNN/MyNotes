Tokens
======
-Tokens can be defined as a punctuator mark, reserved words and each individual word in a statement.
-Token is the smallest unit inside the given program

There are following tokens in Python:
 Keywords
 Identifiers
 Literals
 operators

Keywords
--------
-Keywords are special reserved words which convey a special meaning to the compiler/interpreter. 
-Each keyword have a special meaning and a specific operation. 
-These keywords can't be used as variable. 

list of keywords:
Following is the List of Python Keywords.
True,False,None,and,as,asset,def,class,continue,break,else,finally,elif,del	,except,global,for,if,from,import,raise	,try,or,return,pass,nonloca,in,not,is,lambda

Identifiers
-------------
-Each program elements in a program are given a name called identifiers.
-An identifier is a name given to entities like class, functions, variables, etc. It helps to differentiate one entity from another.
-An Identifier is used to identify the literals used in the program. 

-The rules to name an identifier are given below.
*----------------------------------------------*
1)The first character of the Identifier must be an alphabet or underscore ( _ ).
	myclass, _myvariable, 
2)All the characters except the first character may be an alphabet of lower-case(a-z), upper-case (A-Z), underscore or digit (0-9).
	myClass, Myvarible, My_function,myclass
3)Identifier name must not contain any white-space, or special character (!, @, #, %, ^, &, *).
	my class, my!class
4)Identifier name must not be similar to any keyword defined in the language.
	global=1
5)Identifier names are case sensitive 
	ex : my name, and MyName is not the same.   #this means Python is a case-sensitive language

Examples of valid identifiers : 
	a123, _n, n_9, etc.
Examples of invalid identifiers: 
	1a, n%4, n 9, etc.

Things to remember:
1)Python is a case-sensitive language. This means Variable and variable are not the same.
2)Always give the identifiers a name that makes sense. While c = 10 is a valid name, writing count = 10 would make more sense, and it would be easier to figure out what it represents when you look at your code after a long gap
3)Multiple words can be separated using an underscore, like this_is_a_long_variable

Literals
--------
-Literal is a raw data given in a variable or constant. 
-In Python, there are various types of literals they are as follows:
1)Numeric Literals(integer,float,complext type)
2)String literals
3)Boolean literials(True or False)
4)Special literals(None)
5)Collection literals(lists,tuple,dictionary,set)

All the above will be discussed more in the Variable chapters

operators
---------
-operators are like +, - , * ...etc
in detail will be discussion in Operator chapter

Ex
3+3 = 6


Comments
========
-Comments are very important while writing a program. They describe what is going on inside a program, so that a person looking at the source code does not have a hard time figuring it out.
-this are ignored by the intrepreter

#this is single line comment 

""" 
 this is multipline comment

"""
in detail will be discussion in Comments chapter

Statements
==========
-Instructions that a Python interpreter can execute are called statements
-For example, 

a = 1 
print(a) is an assignment statement. 

if statement, for statement, while statement, etc. are other kinds of statements which will be discussed later

Multi-line statement
--------------------
In Python, the end of a statement is marked by a newline character. But we can make a statement extend over multiple lines with the line continuation character (\). For example:

a = 1 + 2 + 3 + \
    4 + 5 + 6 + \
    7 + 8 + 9

This is an explicit line continuation. In Python, line continuation is implied inside parentheses ( ), brackets [ ], and braces { }.

a = (1 + 2 + 3 +
    4 + 5 + 6 +
    7 + 8 + 9)

Here, the surrounding parentheses ( ) do the line continuation implicitly. Same is the case with [ ] and { }. For example:
colors = ['red',
          'blue',
          'green']

We can also put multiple statements in a single line using semicolons, as follows:
a = 1; b = 2; c = 3

Indentation
===========
-In python each statment are not ended with semicolon(;) but some of the statement like if, for ,while are ended with colon(:)
-Most of the programming languages like C, C++, and Java use braces { } to define a block of code
-Python, however, uses indentation
-A code block (body of a function, loop, etc.) starts with indentation and ends with the first unindented line. The amount of indentation is up to you, but it must be consistent throughout that block
-Generally, four whitespaces are used for indentation and are preferred over tabs
	for i in range(1,11):
	    print(i)
-The enforcement of indentation in Python makes the code look neat and clean
-Indentation can be ignored in line continuation, but it's always a good idea to indent. It makes the code more readable
	if True:
	    print('Hello')
	    a = 5
	 and
	 	if True: print('Hello'); a = 5
-Incorrect indentation will result in IndentationError.

Expression
==========
-An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators
-if you type an expression on the command line, the interpreter evaluates it and displays the result:

1+1

-Although expressions contain values, variables, and operators, not every expression contains all of these elements. A value all by itself is considered an expression, and so is a variable.
-Confusingly, evaluating an expression is not quite the same thing as printing a value

mesage="hello world"
message
print message
