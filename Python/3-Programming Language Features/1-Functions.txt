Introduction
=============
Methods
------
We've already seen a few example of methods when learning about Object and Data Structure Types in Python.
Methods are essentially functions built into objects. Later on in the course we will learn about how to create our own objects and methods using Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and classes.
Methods perform specific actions on an object and can also take arguments, just like a function. This lecture will serve as just a brief introduction to methods and get you thinking about overall design methods that we will touch back upon when we reach OOP in the course.
Methods are in the form:
	object.method(arg1,arg2,etc...)
You'll later see that we can think of methods as having an argument 'self' referring to the object itself. You can't see this argument but we will be using it later on in the course during the OOP lectures.

Functions
---------
-before starting don't get discourged coz it is a new concept. Function_Leap.png
-Formally, a function is a useful device that groups together a set of statements so they can be run more than once. They can also let us specify parameters that can serve as inputs to the functions.
-On a more fundamental level, functions allow us to not have to repeatedly write the same code again and again. If you remember back to the lessons on strings and lists, 
remember that we used a function len() to get the length of a string. Since checking the length of a sequence is a common task you would want to write a function that can do this repeatedly at command.
-Functions will be one of most basic levels of reusing code in Python, and it will also allow us to start thinking of program design 
(we will dive much deeper into the ideas of design when we learn about Object Oriented Programming)

Why even use functions:
Put simply, you should use functions when you plan on using a block of code multiple times. The function will allow you to call the same block of code without having to write it multiple times. 
This in turn will allow you to create more complex Python scripts. To really understand this though, we should actually write our own functions!

Anotomy of functions
===================
function syntax

syntax1:
	def <function_name>(argument1,argument2....):
	    statment
	    statment

syntax2:
	def <function_name>(argument1,argument2....):
	    statment
	    return expression	
 
we begin with def then a space followed by the name of the function. 
Try to keep names relevant, for example len() is a good name for a length() function. 
Also be careful with names, you wouldn't want to call a function the same name as a built-in function in Python (such as len) https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html.
Next come a pair of parentheses with a number of arguments separated by a comma. These arguments are the inputs for your function. 
You'll be able to use these inputs in your function and reference them. After this you put a colon.
Now here is the important step, you must indent to begin the code inside your function correctly. 
Python makes use of whitespace to organize code. Lots of other programing languages do not do this, so keep that in mind.
Next you'll see the docstring, this is where you write a basic description of the function. 
Using Jupyter and Jupyter Notebooks, you'll be able to read these docstrings by pressing Shift+Tab after a function name. 
Docstrings are not necessary for simple functions, but it's good practice to put them in so you or other people can easily understand the code you write.

example1 :

#function without arguments
def sum():
    print("the sum of ss numbers")

#invoking the functions
sum()

example2:
#function  arguments
def greeting(name):
    print(f'Hello {name}')

#invoking the functions 
greeting('Ganesh')

Returning a result
==================
function returning the value based on the return keyword

#function  that return the value
def sum1(a,b):
    return a+b

#invoking the functions 
x=sum1(2,3)
print x

Now the question is what is the diff between Return and Print .
The return keyword allows you to actually save the result of the output of a function as a variable. The print() function simply displays the output to you, but doesn't save it for future use
#function  that return the value
def sum1p(a,b):
    print(a+b)

#invoking the functions 
x=sum1p(2,3)
print x

Returning a multiple values
=============================
s#function  that return the value
def cal(a,b):
    sum1=a+b
    sub=a-b
    mul=a*b
    div=a/b
    return sum1,sub,mul,div

#invoking the functions  
print cal(8,3)

Function overriding and overloading
===================================
Overiding
---------
#in this the it takes the latest method from the top to down approach
def add(a,b):
    print("first one")
    return a+b

def add(c,b):
    print("second one")
    return c+b

add(2,3)

Overloading
-----------
def add(a,b): #here the the same function name but different arguments
    return a+b

def add(a,b,c): #here the the same function name but different arguments
    return a+b+c

add(3,2)
#That’s because methods and functions in Python are limited to one function signature per name
#As soon as you define a new method in the code using the same name, Python will take that method and its parameters as the definition to replace the previous one

#Python users in 2.7 learned to code a makeshift method to code an overloaded function by using nested conditional statements
def add(parameter,*args):
    if parameter=='int':
        result=0
    if parameter=='str':
        result=' '
    for i in args:
        result =result+i
        return result

#If you call the add method by using the following code:
print(add('int',1,2,3))
print(add('str','this'))

#Python 3 added support for method overloading by adding something called single dispatch 
from functools import singledispatch
@singledispatch
def add(a, b):
    print("int")
    return a + b

@add.register(float)
def _(a, b, c):
    print("float")
    return a + b + c

@add.register(str)
def _(a, b, c, d):
    print("str")
    return a + b + c + d

addStuff.registry.keys() #If you need to check what data types your single dispatch methods will use
print(add(3,2))
print(add(3.1,2.1,2.3))
print (add('this', ' is', ' python', ' fun!'))
print (add((1, 2, 3), (3, 4, 5)))
print (add(1.0, 2.1, 3.0))
print(add(3.1,4,3))

local and global variables
============================
-if there is a local variable inside the function, local variables takes the precidence then the global variable.
-if there is no local variables, the global variables take precedence

Example
a=421 #global variables

#function  that return the value
def display():
    a=32    #local variables
    return a; 

#invoking the functions
print display()

Nested Statements and Scope
===========================
Now that we have gone over writing our own functions, it's important to understand how Python deals with the variable names you assign. 
When you create a variable name in Python the name is stored in a name-space. Variable names also have a scope, the scope determines the visibility of that variable name to other parts of your code.

#ex1: checking the local and global variable
x = 25
def printer():
    x = 50
    return x

print(x)
print(printer())

This idea of scope in your code is very important to understand in order to properly assign and call variable names.
In simple terms, the idea of scope can be described by 3 general rules:

-Name assignments will create or change local names by default.
-Name references search (at most) four scopes, these are:
*local
*enclosing functions
*global
*built-in
-Names declared in global and nonlocal statements map assigned names to enclosing module and function scopes.

Local
-----
When you declare variables inside a function definition, they are not related in any way to other variables with the same names used outside the function - i.e. variable names are local to the function. This is called the scope of the variable. 
All variables have the scope of the block they are declared in starting from the point of definition of the name.

x = 50

def func(x):
    print('x is', x)
    x = 2
    print('Changed local x to', x)

func(x)
print('x is still', x)

Built-in
--------
len

Enclosing function locals
-------------------------
name = 'This is a global name'

def greet():
    # Enclosing function
    name = 'Sammy'
    print(name)
    def hello():
        print('Hello '+name)
    
    hello()

greet()

Globals functions:
------------------
If you want to assign a value to a name defined at the top level of the program (i.e. not inside any kind of scope such as functions or classes), then you have to tell Python that the name is not local, but it is global. We do this using the global statement. 
It is impossible to assign a value to a variable defined outside a function without the global statemen
-use the globals() functions followed by the variable name

a=421 #global variables

#function  that return the value
def display():
    a=32    #local variables
    print a
    print(globals()['a']) #accessing global variables

#invoking the functions
print display()

assigning function to a variable
==================================

a=421 #global variables

#function  that return the value
def display():
    a=32    #local variables
    print a
    print(globals()['a']) #accessing global variables

#invoking the functions
print(a) 
z=display #assining a function to a variable, then that variable behaves like a functions
print "----"
z()
print "----"
z()
print "----"
z()

function inside another function
================================

ex:
def display(name):
    def message(): #inner functions
        return "hello"
    result = message()+ " " +name
    return result

print display("bharath")

Interactions between functions
-----------------------------
ex=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
from random import shuffle
shuffle(ex) #this shuffle function will randomly swipe the number
ex

#lets get into logic building
#shuffle the list
mylist = [' ','O',' ']
def shufflelist():
    shuffle(mylist)
    return mylist
shufflelist()

#guess the number
def playguess():
    guess=''
    while guess not in ['0','1','2']:
        guess = input("pick any guess 0, 1 or 2: ")
    return int(guess)
playguess()

#lets combine together
#guess the game , if the index falls on the mylist it picks
def checkguess(mixedlist,guess):
    if mylist[guess]=='O':
        print("Correct Guess")
    else:
        print("Wrong! Best of luck here")
        print(mylist)


mylist = [' ','O',' ']

#guess the no#
guess = playguess()

#store the mylist 
mixedlist=shuffle(mylist)

#guess the gane
checkguess(mixedlist,guess)

function as paramter to an other
================================

ex:
def display(name): #first function 
    return "hello " + name

def name(): #second functions
    return "Ganesh"

#calling other function as paramter
print display(name())

Returing the function
=====================

def display():
    def message():
        return "hello"
    return message #returing a function to caller of the functions

fun = display()
print fun

pass any type
=============
-pass any type to a functions

def display(lst):
    for i in lst:
        print(i)
        
        
aa = [1,3,4,5,3]
display(aa)

recursion
=========

def factorial(n):
    if n==0:
        result =1
    else:
        result=n*factorial(n-1) #this is where the recurusion happening
    return result

print factorial(5)

keyword argument
================
-changing the argument values based on the keyword assignment

def average(a,b):
    print a
    print b
    return (a+b)/2

print average(10,20)  #normal call type
print("--------")
print(average(a=10, b=20))
print("--------")
print(average(b=10, a=20))#interchanging the keyword argument

default arguments
=================

def average(a=20,b=30):
    print a
    print b
    return (a+b)/2

print average() 
print "------"
print average(b=43) 
print "------"


*args and **kwargs
==================
*args
-----
When a function parameter starts with an asterisk, it allows for an arbitrary number of arguments, and the function takes them in as a tuple of values. Rewriting the above function:

def myfunc(*args):
    return sum(args)*.05

myfunc(40,60,20)

**kwargs
--------
Similarly, Python offers a way to handle arbitrary numbers of keyworded arguments. Instead of creating a tuple of values, **kwargs builds a dictionary of key/value pairs. For example

def myfunc(**kwargs):
    if 'fruit' in kwargs:
        print(f"My favorite fruit is {kwargs['fruit']}")  # review String Formatting and f-strings if this syntax is unfamiliar
    else:
        print("I don't like fruit")
        
myfunc(fruit='pineapple')

myfunc()

*args and **kwargs combined
---------------------------

def myfunc(*args, **kwargs):
    if 'fruit' and 'juice' in kwargs:
        print(f"I like {' and '.join(args)} and my favorite fruit is {kwargs['fruit']}")
        print(f"May I have some {kwargs['juice']} juice?")
    else:
        pass
        
myfunc('eggs','spam',fruit='cherries',juice='orange')

myfunc(fruit='cherries',juice='orange','eggs','spam')

As with "args", you can use any name you'd like for keyworded arguments - "kwargs" is just a popular convention.

Built in Functions
==================
all() and any()
---------------
all() and any() are built-in functions in Python that allow us to conveniently check for boolean matching in an iterable. all() will return True if all elements in an iterable are True. It is the same as this function code:
def all(iterable):
    for element in iterable:
        if not element:
            return False
    return True

any() will return True if any of the elements in the iterable are True. It is equivalent to the following function code:
def any(iterable):
    for element in iterable:
        if element:
            return True
    return False

lst = [True,True,False,True]
all(lst)

Returns False because not all elements are True.
any(lst)
Returns True because at least one of the elements in the list is True

f)Write a function that computes the volume of a sphere given its radius
g)Write a function that checks whether a number is in a given range (inclusive of high and low)
h)Write a Python function that accepts a string and calculates the number of upper case letters and lower case letters.

k)Write a Python function that checks whether a word or phrase is palindrome or not
Note: A palindrome is word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, 
e.g., madam,kayak,racecar, or a phrase "nurses run". Hint: 
You may want to check out the .replace() method in a string to help out with dealing with spaces.
Also google search how to reverse a string in Python, there are some clever ways to do it with slicing notation
L)Write a Python function to check whether a string is pangram or not. (Assume the string passed in does not have any punctuation)
	Note : Pangrams are words or sentences containing every letter of the alphabet at least once.
	For example : "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
	Hint: You may want to use .replace() method to get rid of spaces.
	Hint: Look at the string module(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16060899/alphabet-range-in-python)
	Hint: In case you want to use set comparisons(https://medium.com/better-programming/a-visual-guide-to-set-comparisons-in-python-6ab7edb9ec41Z)
i)Write a funciton that takes arbitrary number of arguments and returns a list contianing only those arguments that are even.
