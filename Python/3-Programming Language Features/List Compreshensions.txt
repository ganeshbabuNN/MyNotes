List comprehensions 

list comprehension
=================
-List Comprehension is defined as an elegant way to define, create a list in Python and consists of brackets that contains an expression followed by for clause
-generally used to apply logic each item in th elist.

The list comprehension starts with '[' and ']'.

[ <expression> for <item> in <list> if <conditional>]

ex: Program to convery string into a list each letter wise.
#convert the below string to list
mystring="ganesh babu"

mylist=[]
for letter in mystring:
    mylist.append(letter)
    print(letter) 
	
#using list comprehension
mylist=[letter for letter in mystring]


EX:Program to cube of number in a list
# traditional way
 lst=[]
 for x in range(1,10):
     lst.append(x**3) 
 print lst

#using list comprehension way
lst=[]
lst=[x**3 for x in range(1,11)]
print lst

ex: Program to even numbers in a list
#Traditional way
for i in range(1,20):
    if i%2==0:
        print(i)

#using list comp 
lst =[x for x in range(1,31) if x%2==0]
print lst

#one way using range method
lst=[x for x in range(2,21,2)]
print lst

Ex:program to convert celsius to Fahrenheit
#https://www.britannica.com/science/Fahrenheit-temperature-scale

cel = [40,28,46,27,88]

fahi=[]
for i in cel:
    c = (9/5 * i +32)
    fahi.append(c)

fahi

#Using list comprehension
fahi=[(9/5 * i +32) for i in cel]

fahi
ex: program to convert Product of numbers in a list
# regular way
a=[1,2,3,4,5,6]
b=[6,7,8,9,10,3]

z=[]
for i in range(len(a)):
    z.append(a[i]*b[i])
    
print z

# using list comprehension
t=[a[i]*b[i] for i in range(len(a))]
print t

ex: program to find common element in a list
# regular way
a=[2,4,6,8,10]
b=[1,2,3,4,5,6]

z=[]
for i in a:
    if i in b:
        z.append(i)
print z
    
#using the list comprehension
result1 =[i for i in a if i in b]
print result1

Ex: Nested list comprehension
lst = [ x**2 for x in [x**2 for x in range(11)]]
lst

Quiz:

Assignment:
=========== 
1.Use for,.split() and if to create a Statement that will print out words that start with 's':
	st = 'Print only the words that start with s in this sentence'
2.Use range() to print all the even numbers from 0 to 10.
3.Use List comprehension to create a list of all numbers between 1 and 50 that are divisible by 3
4.Go through the string below and if the length of a word is even print "even!"
st = 'Print every word in this sentence that has an even number of letters'
5 Write a program that prints the integers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five #print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz"
#6.Use List Comprehension to create a list of the first letters of every word in the string below:
