-The programming language typically support set of operators.
-VBA typically support set of operators performing some operations.

Like ..
a+b  + is a addition operator, a and b operand.

Different types of operators
============================
1)Arthmetic Operator
2)Comparison Operator
3)Logical Operator

1)Arthmetic Operator
-------------------
Operator		Example
--------		------- 
^(Exponential)		Msgbox 2^2
*(Multiplication)	Msgbox 2*2
/(Division)		Msgbox 12/4
Mod(Modulus)		Msgbox 12 mod 4
+ or & (String concat)	MsgBox “Ganesh"&“babu" or “Nirmal"+“Kumar" produces a new string 				"Excel VBA 2010"

2)Comparion Operator
--------------------
Operator		Example
--------		--------
<(Less than)		Msgbox 2<3
<(Less than or eq)	Msgbox 3<=4
>(greater than)		Msgbox 2>3
>=(greater than or eq)	Msgbox 3>=4
=(Equal)		Msgbox 3=3
<>(Not equal to)	Msgbox 9<>10

3)Logical Operator
-----------------
Operator			Example
--------			--------
And(Logical conjunction)	If a >= 80 And b < 101 Then  grade = "A"
Or(Logical disjunction)		If a >= 80 Or b < 101 Then  grade = "A"
Not(Logical negation)		MsgBox Not (3 > 4)

Comparing the objects
=====================-
Using the is Operator

Checking whether the value is Text or Number
===========================================

Using isText function
=====================

Operator Precedence
===================
Precedence

-If several operators exist in a single expression and parentheses have not been used then the expression is evaluated in a strict order. This order is known as "operator precedence"
-When operators have the same precedence they are evaluated from left-to-right.
-Parentheses can be used to overwrite the order and to evaluate certain parts of the expression. Operations inside parentheses are always performed before those outside.
-When a series of operators appear in the same expression there is a strict order in which they will be evaluated.
-The rules of precedence tell the compiler which operators to evaluate first.
-Parentheses can obviously be used to change the order of precedence.
-Operators are evaluated in the following order: Mathematical, Concatenation, Relational, Logical.

Order	Operator		Symbol
1		Exponentiation	^
2		Negation		-
3		Multiplication	*
3		Division		/
4		Division with Integer result	\
5		Modulo			Mod
6		Addition		+
6		Subtraction		-
7		String Concatenation	&
8		Equal or Assignment	=
8		Not Equal To	<>
8		Less Than	<
8		Greater Than	>
8		Less Than or Equal To	<=
8		Greater Than or Equal To	>=
9		Not				NOT
10		And				AND
11		Or				OR
12		Exclusive OR	XOR
13		Equivalence		EQV
14		Implication		IMP
