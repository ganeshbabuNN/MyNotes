Three ways of using the on Error Statement in VBA
==================================================
1)On Error GoTo Label
2)On Error Resume Next
3)On Error Goto 0

On Error GoTo Label
-------------------
After executing this statement, VBA resumes execution at the specified line. You must include a colon after the label so that VBA recognizes it as a label.

syntax:
sub test()
   statement 1;		
   statement 2;
   statement 3;
   on error goto label1:
   statement 4;
   statement 5;
   exit sub
label1:
  statment 5
end sub


Ex
- IF any error occurred inside the block, it deligates to the hanlder block. This handler block should be after "Exit Sub".

Sub checkerror()
 Dim number As Integer
 Dim result As Integer
 'enter the character and check
 On Error GoTo Handler:
 number = InputBox("Enter the number ")
 result = number + 1
 MsgBox result
  Exit Sub
Handler:
 MsgBox "This is not a number"
' ' for multiple handler can be provided.
'Handler1:
' MsgBox "This is not a number1"
End Sub


2)On Error Resume Next
----------------------
After executing this statement, VBA simply ignores all errors and resumes execution with the next statement.

syntax:
sub test()
   statement 1;		
   statement 2;
   statement 3;
 On Error Resume Next
   statement 4;
   statement 5;
   exit sub 
end sub

ex
- IF any error occurred inside the block, it ignores the error , continued with the expression, for numeric calculations it defaults to zero

Sub checkerror()
 Dim number As Integer
 Dim result As Integer
 'enter the character and check
 On Error Resume Next
 number = InputBox("Enter the number ")
 result = number + 1
 MsgBox result
 Exit Sub
End Sub

3)On Error Goto 0
------------------
After executing this statement, VBA  resumes its normal error-checking behavior.Use this statement after using one of the
other On Error statements or when you want to remove error handling in your procedure

syntax:
sub test()
   statement 1;		
   statement 2;
   statement 3;
 On Error Goto 0
   statement 4;
   statement 5;
   exit sub 
end sub

ex
-By default if any error occurred inside the block, its takes the blank line.

Sub checkerror()
 Dim number As Integer
 Dim result As Integer
 'enter the character and check
 On Error GoTo 0
 number = InputBox("Enter the number ")
 result = number + 1
 MsgBox result
 Exit Sub
End Sub
