To determine the ODBC connection and query strings, set query options manually, and use the QueryString property to return the connection string. The following table includes some commonly used SQL keywords.
Keyword Description 
DSN The name of the ODBC data source

Access 2007 provides two-way snychronisation between Access and SharePoint lists so you can work with lists offline and then synchronise the changes when you reconnect.

Integration with WSS makes Access 2007 a great colloboration tool while enablying data to be stored on enterprise servers to better manageability
Access 2007 allows you to export and import data to and from SharePoint lists
In this scenario changes made in Access 2007 are not reflected in SharePoint and vica versa

Exporting Tables To SharePoint


select the table
select (External Data tab, Export)(SharePoint List)

A "Move to SharePoint Site Issues" table appears in the Access navigation pane that details aspects of the data that could not be applied to the sharepoint list

By saving the export query you can now repeat the above steps without using the wizard
Your saved exports can be found under the External Data tab in the Export group
Similarly you can save your export as a Microsoft Outlook task which you can then configure to remind you to run the export query.

Importing Lists to Access

External Data tab
Import > SharePoint list

The following options are available on a dialog box
Not Linked !!
Linked !!

When you import data from a SharePoint list, the imported data are based on a view and only those columns and rows in the view are imported
You can select the required view from the Items to Import drop-down list

The Import displays values instead of IDs for lookup values stored in another list and allows you to maintain the lookup relationship that this list may have with other sharepoint lists.

Changes to the sharepoint list are NOT copied back to the Access table nor are changes to the Access database reflected back in the sharepoint list.
A linked object is not created as part of this process.

Linking Lists

If you do not want to maintain two copies of that data but do need to refer to the data within Access then Access 2007 provides methods of accessing external data that are physically located outside an Access database
The easiest way to externally reference a SharePoint lists is to use linked tables
A linked table stores only a connection to the sharepoint list
You should use linking rather than importing if the data are maintained by either a user or a separate application on the sharepoint web site.

Check that the "Link to the data source by creating a linked table" option is selected and click Next

The Get External Data - sharepoint list dialog box closes
Access now has two linked tables
The sharepoint list contains columns "Created by" and "Modified by"
These lookup columns point to the User Information List ???

A context sensitive menu is displayed that provides a quick way to manage the sharepoint list from within Access.

By moving to another row, Access automatically synchronises changes to the sharepoint list.

Moving Tables To SharePoint

You can move a database to a sharepoint site
Data is moved to sharepoint lists and the database file is moved to a document library.

Many Access applications grow from the need to manage and aggregate data
These data-centric applications often prove useful to more than one person in an organisation and thus the need to share them increases.
However Access 2007 is not truly meant for concurrent use
As an Access database grows and becomes more complex, it is necessary to consider upsizing them to a data repository that can support more users while increasing availablity, reliability and manageability
With Access 2007 you can now upsize your database to Windows SharePoint Services which is known as "Publishing your database"

When you move data from an Access database to a sharepoint site this process creates a sharepoint list for each Access table
Data from Access tables move into these sharepoint lists and each data row becomes a list item in a sharepoint list
Tables in the Access database are replaced with linked tables that point to the newly created sharepoint list(s)
Optionally the Access database now becomes a user interface to the data by retaining views, reports and relationships between tables
Access views also appear as sharepoint list views

Because the data is now in sharepoint you can use sharepoint functionality
For example you can restore deleted list items from the Recycle Bin and apply workflow rules to data items
Changes to the list are versioned by defaukt
If you choose to save the database in the document library, users who wish to use the database can navigate to the document library in their browser, where the database can be opened in Access

Access 2007 users can either add and modify data by using either sharepoint or the linked tables within an Access database

External Data tab
SharePoint lists > Move to sharepoint

Other changes, file can be treated as a document - check in / check out changes

If you make changes to the Access database, such as creating a new biew or report then the database file can be saved to the document library on the server by publishing changes
