Passing the argument by ByRef and ByVal
---------------------------------------
-You can pass arguments to a procedure (function or sub) by reference or by value
-By default, Excel VBA passes arguments by reference. As always, we will use an easy example to make things more clear

-Place a command button and reference the procedures to Test procedure.
sub test
Dim x As Integer
x = 10
MsgBox Triple(x)
MsgBox x
end sub

-Create the function for demostrating the references "ByRef" as argument
Function Triple(ByRef x As Integer) As Integer
x = x * 3
Triple = x
End Function

-When you run the command button the output will be 30 and 30 
-Modify the existing function for demostrating the references "ByVal" as argument
Function Triple(ByVal x As Integer) As Integer
x = x * 3
Triple = x
End Function

-output will be 30 and 30

-When passing arguments by reference we are referencing the original value. The value of x (the original value) is changed in the function. As a result the second MsgBox displays a value of 30. 
-When passing arguments by value we are passing a copy to the function. The original value is not changed. As a result the second MsgBox displays a value of 10 (the original value).
