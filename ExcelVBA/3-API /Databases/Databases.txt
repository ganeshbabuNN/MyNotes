What is Databases
=================
-A database is structured collection of data.


Struture and Unstructured data
==============================


How the data strutures look?
============================
-Fields, Records & Tables
-Relationship
-Rules(Constraints)

Example of database
-A database keeps VBA Class details likes 
Student information,
Feedback information,
Fees information,
Class type informations.

Database Concepts
=================
-Entity
-Relationship
-Primary Key
-Foreign Key
-Index
-Query
-View
-Table Definiations
-Normalization
-Integrity
-Transaction
-ACID Rules

Entity & Relationship
---------------------
-Entity : An idependent thing like student info, class type,feedback info
-Relationship : How two or more entities are related like students fee information, student class information

Primary & Foreign Key
---------------------
-Primary Key : Uniquely identifies a record in a table
-Foriegn Key : A field in a table matches the primary key column of another table.

index
-----
-Index helps you search fast
-Makes you tables like yellow pages
-Index on student names
-Index on email address
-Index on Number of fees per student

Query & View
------------
-Query : Ask a question to your database
	a) How many students are joined on 24-Nov-2016
	b) What are the different types of classes we have.
-View : A ready to access to query

Tables Definition
-----------------
-Instruct how the table are defined
1)Fields & Their data types
2)Primary keys
3)Foreign Keys
4)Constraints
5)Indices

Normalization
-------------
-Process of removing redundancy in your database, so that database can be consistently and correctly modified

Integrity
---------
-Data entered in to a database must be accurate , valid and consitent.
1)Entity integrity: not allowing multiple rows to have the same identity within a table.
2)Domain integrity: restricting data to predefined data types eg dates
3)Referential integrity: requiring the existence of a related rows in another table eg comment can be posted only by a valid student

Transation
----------
A change made to a database tables
-Adding a student name
-Updating a fees details

ACID
----
ACID : Atomicity ,Consistency , Isolation and Durability
-Atomicity states that database modification must follow an "all or nothing" rule.
-Consistency states that only valid data will be written to the database
-Isolation requires that multiple transactions occuring at the same time not impact each other's executions
-Durablity ensures that any transaction committed to the database will not be lost.
