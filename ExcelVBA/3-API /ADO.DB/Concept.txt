Microsoft related technologies adopted a framework called as MDAC(Microsoft Data Access Components) that allows programmer to develop applications that can access any data store.
Components included are
1)ADO(ActiveX Database Objects)
2)OLE DB (Object Linking and Embeded)
3)ODBC(Open Database Connectivity)

Steps required to connect to database(OLE DB)
==============================================
Understanding the steps to connect to the database : 
1. connecting to a database .
2. Universal Data Link (UDL) files to assist in creating the connection strings. 
3. Using the connection string to connect to a database. 
4. Using Microsoft Data Access type library. 
5. listing all table names from a database when we are not aware of their names. 
6. Reading and write data from a database table into our excel sheet.

Setup the UDL
------------
1)Open a blank NotePad
2)Save the notepad fila name as name.udl 
3)Right on the name.udl file properties and click the provider list.Choose the apporiate one and click ok
4)use the connection string for use.
5)Before using the Writing the code  enable the reference for the ADO or any related components required from 
tools--> References --> Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects 2.8 Library (OLE DB)

Note
----
-Components of Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects 2.8 Library which will used from the 2007 Later version like access..etc , Legacy are widely used by Microsoft Jet Engines
-MS jet 4.0 OLE DB provider are used for the 2007 early Access DB.

Block structure
---------------
- Always create a global variable in the module where the connection reference can be reused across the subroutines/functions and recommended to use the early binding instead of late binding.And this is the good pratice as well
	Dim cnn As New ADODB.Connection
	Dim rs As New ADODB.Recordset
-in any subroutines/functions use the block to iterate the records by record
  Do While Not rs.EOF
        --- statement
        rs.MoveNext
    Loop
-At end ofthe subroutines/function close the connection which has been declared or used
	rs.close 'for the recordset
	cnn.close 'for the connection object

Excel as Database
================
-This basically treats reterving the data via SQL satements
-Before using the Writing the code  enable the reference for the ADO or any related components required from 
tools--> References --> Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects 2.8 Library (OLE DB) and ensure other systems has been using this similar COM objects used

- Always create a global variable in the module where the connection reference can be reused across the subroutines/functions and recommended to use the early binding instead of late binding.And this is the good pratice as well
	Dim cnn As New ADODB.Connection
	Dim rs As New ADODB.Recordset

-Ensure the connection string should be 
	cnn.ConnectionString = "Driver={Microsoft Excel Driver (*.xls, *.xlsx, *.xlsm, *.xlsb)};DBQ=" &	ActiveWorkbook.Path_		& Application.PathSeparator & ActiveWorkbook.Name

-Inany subroutines/functions use the block to iterate the records by record
  	Do While Not rs.EOF
        --- statement
        rs.MoveNext
        Loop
-At end ofthe subroutines/function close the connection which has been declared or used
	rs.close 'for the recordset
	cnn.close 'for the connection object
