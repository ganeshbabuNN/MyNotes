Process invovled
----------------
-You must open a file before any I/O operation can be performed on it. Open allocates a buffer for I/O to the file and determines the mode of access to use with the buffer.
-If the file specified by pathname doesn't exist, it is created when a file is opened for Append, Binary, Output, or Random modes.
-If the file is already opened by another process and the specified type of access is not allowed, the Open operation fails and an error occurs
