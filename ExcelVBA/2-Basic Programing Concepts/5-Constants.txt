Intro
=====
-A constant is a meaningful name that takes the place of a value that does not change.
-You should always use constants in place of hard coded values or strings.
-Constants must be declared at the very top and cannot be declared below any properties, subroutines or functions.
-Unlike variables, constants cannot be inadvertently changed at run-time.
-You cannot use any variables, user defined function or any built-in functions in your declarations.
-You should always declare your constants with specific data types (never with a Variant data type).
-All public constants and variables should be in capitals except for the data type prefix

There are two type of constants
-In built constants
-Custom constants

Custtom Constant
================
Rules
-The rules remain same has the variable
sytnax :
In VBA, we need to assign a value to the declared Constants. An error is thrown, if we try to change the value of the constant.
    Const <<constant_name>> As <<constant_type>> = <<constant_value>>

ex:
Sub constdemo()
    Const myname = "My name is ganesh" 'constant declarations
    myname = "no"
    MsgBox myname
End Sub

Constants Scope
===============
-The default scope for constants is Private.
Constants have scope and this scope is identical to that defined for variables.
This constant can only be used in the module that it is declared.

Public Const g_sVERSION As String = "4.0.3" 

Expression
==========
A constant can be defined using other, already declared constants.

Types of Constants
==================
The VBA Language has several types of constants.
1)Literal constants A specific value such as a number, date or text string that cannot change.
2)ymbolic constants - A literal constant that is represented by a name.
3)Enumerations - A grouping of symbolic constants into categories.
4)Built-in constants - These are typically in the form of enumerations.

If you do not declare the data type of the constant then the most appropriate data type for the expression is used
In class modules constants can only be Private and their visibility cannot be changed to Public.


In-Bult Constants
=================
1)Miscellaneous Constants like vbNewLine,vbTab,vbBack
