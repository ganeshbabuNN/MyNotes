Example
=======
Sub LEExample()
    Dim a As Integer
     a = 6
    MsgBox a
End Sub

In this example, the compiler groups the characters into these tokens.

identifiers:
LEExample a 

operators:
( ) =

punctuators
--NA---

keywords
Sub ,Dim, as , integer, sub

constants
 6

Sytnax
========
Automatic Formatting
Indentation and White Space
One Instruction Per Line
Line Continuation Character
Auto Syntax Check
-----------------
-As you type your code it is automatically checked for syntax errors.
-If any syntax errors are found then you are alerted with a pop up message box.
-For example any misspelled keywords or missing separators will be identified

Navigate to Tools--> options --> check auto Syntax Check.

What happen when When this option is switched On?

Sematics
========
Logics


Tokens
======
The characters in a program which are grouped by the compiler. The compiler basically collects the characters of the program into tokens or syntactic units

keywords
--------
-Keywords are special words that are reserved.
-These keywords are used by the compiler to determine the structure of your code.
-These are displayed in Blue by default in the Code window.
-These cannot be used for variables or procedure or function names.

identifiers
-----------
Here there is no concept of identifier in VBA Langague

constants
---------
-constants are explained in future chapter.

Operators
---------
- Operator are explained in future chapter.

punctuators
-----------
-there is no such puncator in this language.
for string it is " "
for a character it is ''

lexical dissection
==================
The process of collecting the characters of a program into syntactic units or tokens.

Comments
========
-A comment block is considered a syntactic unit, but it is not a token of VBA language because the compiler ignores comments.
-Comments are used to document the program logic and the user information with which other programmers can seamlessly work on the same code in future.
-It includes information such as developed by, modified by, and can also include incorporated logic. Comments are ignored by the interpreter while execution.

Comments in VBA are denoted by two methods.
1)Any statement that starts with a Single Quote (') is treated as comment. 
Following is an example
 'this script call other functions
 i = star_func(12)

2)Any statement that starts with the keyword "REM". Following is an example

 REM this script call other functions
 i = star_func(12)

-The Comment Block and UnComment Block buttons on the Edit toolbar can be very useful for commenting out several lines of code in one step
