Scope & Visibility
==================
-Scope refers to the availablity of a variable, constant , procedures and functions.
-There are three scoping levels
1)procedure/function-level
2)Private module-level
3)public module-level

-Scoping can be determined while declaring them

1)procedure/function-level
-----------------
-A variable or constant defined inside a procedure is not visible /available to other procedures
-it can be used within the procedures where it has been declared

2)Private module-level
----------------------
-These are defined at the declarations section of the module and are availble to entire single module
-These can be private and public
-private variable, constant , procedures and functions are available only within they have been declared

3)public module-level
---------------------
-They can be defined in any module at the declarations sections and will be available to all modules in the current project
-public variables,constants,procedures, functions are available to all modules within the current project.
