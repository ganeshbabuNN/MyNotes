#setting the seed for random number generation
----------------------------------------------
-Each time you generate pseudo-random dviates, a different seed and therefore different results are produced.
-To make your results reproducible, you can specify the seed explicitly , using the sed.seed() functions.
-runif() function is used generate pseudo-random numbers from a uniform distributions on the interval 0 to 1.


#generating the multivaritate normal data
-----------------------------------------
-You often want to draw data from a multivaritate normal distribution with a given mean vector and covariance matrix.
-the mvnorm() function in the MASS package makes this easy .
format
		mvrnorm(n,mean,sigma)
-where n is the desired sample size, mean is the vector of means and sigma is the variance-covariances(or correlation)matrix.
