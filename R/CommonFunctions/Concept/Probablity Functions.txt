Probablity Functions
====================
-This functiosn are often used to generate simulated data with known characteristics and to calculate probablity values within user-written statistical functions.
-In R Probability functions take the form

[dpqr]distribution_abbreviation()
where the first letter refers to the aspect of the distributions returned.
d=density
p=distributions functions
q=quantile function
r =random generations (random deviates)
