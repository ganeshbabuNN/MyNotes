-Basically we are hear to creating graphs and saving them in a variety of formats and 
majority concepts is modifying the default graphs produced by R.
-Overall modification means like graphs axes,fonts,symbols,lines and colours 
And adding titles,subtitles,labels,plotted text,legends and reference lines. And also specify the size of the graph and margins
-This will apply to all graphs except to ggplot2.
-Graph can be saved in a PDF document or other format like
*win.metafile(),png(),jpeg(),bmp(),tiff(),xfig() and postscript() to save the graph in other format.
-Create a new graph by issuing the high level plotting command such as plot(),hist() or boxplot() typically overwrites a previous graph
format	
	dev.new()
	 statement for graph1
	dev.new()
	 statement for graph2
	 etct..
*this will access multiple graph via GUI.
*For viewing the graph previous and forward differe in OS type on Mac at any time using back and forward, whereas in windows
after opening first graph window, choose history > recording and then previous and next menu itmes to setp through graph.
*Or using dev.new(),dev.next(),dev.prev(),dev.set() and dev.off() to have multiple graph window open at one time on any platform.
