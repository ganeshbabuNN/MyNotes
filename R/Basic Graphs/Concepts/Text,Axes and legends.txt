Text,Axes and legends
=====================
-Other High level plotting functions allows to includes axis and text options as well as graphical parameter like adding 
title(main),subtitle(sub),axis labels(xlab,ylab) and axis ranges(xlim,ylim).
-And some of the other plotting functions includes default titles and labels and these can be removed by adding options
ann=FALSE in the plot() statement or in separte par() functions

Title
-----
-Use the title() functions to add and axis labels to a plot.
format	
	title(main="main title",sub="subtitle",xlab="x-axis label",ylab="y-axis label")
-Graphical parameter like text size,font,rotations and color can also be specified in title().

Axes
----
-R uses Default axes, you can create custom axes with the axis() functions
format	
	axis(side,at=,labels=,pos=,lty=,col=,las=,tck=,...)
-By default, when creating a custom axis , you should suppress the axis that automatically generated by the high level plotting functions.
-the options ann=FALSE suppress all axes, including all axis frame lines unless you add the options frame.plot=TRUE.
-the options xaxt="n" and yaxt="n" suppress the x-axis and y-axis respectively.(leaveing frame lines without ticks)
-By default plot functions creates major tick marks but not the minor tick marks. for that Hmisc packages need to be installed
format
		library(Hmisc)
		minor.tick(nx=n,ny=n, tick.ratio=n)
 *nx and ny specify the intervals into which divide the area between major tick marks on the x and y-axis.
 *tick.ratio is the size of the minor tick mark relative to the major tick mark.

Reference Lines
---------------
-The abline() functison is used to add reference lines to a graph. The format is
	abline(h=yvalues,v=xvalues)
-with other graphical parameters (such as line type, color and width) can also be specified in the abline() functions.
abline(h=c(1,5,7))
-adds solid horizontal lines at y=1,5 and 7 where as code 
abline(v=c(1,10,2),lty=2,col="blue") 
-legened can be added with the lengend() functions
 format
		legend (location,title,legend, ....)
 *here locations are bottomleft, left,topleft,top,topright,right,bottomright or center.
 *title - character string for lengent title
 *legend - character vector with the label
 *... other options, bg for background color, cex for size, text.col for text colour. 
 Specifying horiz=TRUE sets the legend horizontal rather then vertically.

Text annotations
----------------
-Text can be added to graphs using text() and mtext() functions.
-text() places text within the graph, whereas mtext() places text in one of the four margins.
format
	text(location,"text to place"",pos,....)
	mtext("text to place",side,line=n,.....)
*location - location can be x, y co-ordinate, you can text interactively iva mouse by specifying location as locator(1).
*pos = positive relative to location, 1=below,2=left,3=above and 4=right. if you spec ps,you can specify offset= %
*side=which margin to place text in , where 1=bottom,2=left,3=top and 4=right.
-it is typically used to labelling points as well as for ading other text annotations.
-Use family options to display the font familyes.The par() functions was used to increase the font size to produce a better display.

Math annotations
----------------
-R allows to add any mathematical symbols and formules to a graph using TeX-like rules.
-Use platomath() function to add the mathematical symbols to titles , axis labels or text annotations in the body or margins of a graph.
-Refer help(plotmath)
