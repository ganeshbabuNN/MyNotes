- R is a case-sensitive , interpreted language.
- We can run commands at a time at command prompt or run a set of commands from a source file.
- Most of the functinality is provided through built-in and user-created functions and Creations and the creations and manipulation of objects.

Objects
=======
-It is basically anything that can be assigned a value. 
-R is just about everything like data, functions, graphs, analytic ,results and more.
-Every object has a class attribute telling R how to handle it.
-All objects are kept in memory during an interactive session.
-Basic functions are available by default.

> r <- rnorm(5)
[1]  0.81528452  1.30019407 -0.24559799 -1.53660717 -0.04692311

or we can use another way, this will make funny
rnorm(5) -> x

Here this statement creates a vector object named x containing five random deviates from standard nomral distributions


Note:
-R allows the = sign to be used for object assignment.But in reality many other program will find many programs written that way coz it is not a standard syntax.

Object Types
============
-In R , There are wide variety of objects for holding data  

1)Scalar
2)vectors
3)matrices
4)arrays
5)data frames
6)lists

This will more indetailed explained in the data structures sessions
