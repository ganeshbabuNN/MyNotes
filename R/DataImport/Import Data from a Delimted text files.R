#Observetion
#The term social studies renamed to follow R conventions
#studentid column is now a row names, no longer a label and lost leading zero
#the missing science grade for jane is correctly read as missing.
#quotations marks around dan last name in order to escape the comma betwen thornton and III
#for mary single quotations marks around O'Leary other else R will have read the single quote as string delimiter.
#finally first and last names are converted as factors
#By default read.table() converts character value to factor

#Let us suppress this behaviour for all character variables including the optio stringAsFactors=FALSE and colClasses options to specify a class
