Data structures in R
====================
-In R , There are wide variety of objects for holding data  

1)Scalar
2)vectors
3)matrices
4)arrays
5)data frames
6)lists
-They differs in terms of type of data they can hold, how they're created their structural complexity and notation used to identify and access individual elements.

Note:
----
-An object is anything that can be assigned to a variable.
-It may includes constants data structures, functions and even graphs.
-An object has a mode(which describes how the object is stored and a class(which tells generic functions like pring how to handle it)
-Data frames is a struture in R that holds data and similar to a datasets . the columns are variables and rows are obersvations.
-Data frames are main structures you use to store datasets.
-Factors are nominal or ordinal variables. they're stored and treated specially in R.
-Terminology used in statistics and computer in general may be familiar

1.Scalar
--------
-Scalar are one-element vector
-they are used to hold constants basically

ex
	f <- 3
	f <- "ganesh"
	f <- TRUE

Refer Object_vector_scalar.R for example.

2.Vector
--------
-Vector are one-dimensional array that can hold numeric data, character data or logical data
-the combine function c() to used to form the vector.
usage
	object <- c(data with only one mode)
- Data in a vector must be only one type or mode not mix modes in the same vector
ex
	a <- c(2,3,1,3)  - numeric vector
	b <- c("con", "dd", "eee") - character vector
	c <- c(TRUE,FALSE,TRUE)- logical vector
- vector can be refer to a elements of a vector using a numeric vector of positions within brackerts.
ex
	a[c(2,4)] -- refere to the 2nd and 4th element of vector
- the colon vector used in the last statement generates a sequences of number.
ex
	a <- c(2:6) equivalent a <- c(2,3,4,5,6)

Refer Object_vector.R for example.

3.Matrices
----------
-A matric is a two-dimensional array in which each element has the same mode (numeric,character or logical).
-its create using matrix() function.
-These are two-dimensional and like vectors can contain only one data type. when there are more than one dimension, use array and where there are mutliple modes of data, you use data framews

Usage

	mymatrix <- matrix(vector,nrow=number_of_rows,ncol=number_of_columns,byrow=logical_value,dimnames=list		    (char_vector_rownames,char_vector_colnames))

*vector contains the element of the matrix
*nrow and ncol specify the row and column stored in character vectors
*byrow is a optional, it indicates whether the matrix should be in row(byrow=TRUE) or by column(byrow=FALSE), default is column

-Accessing the elements by using subscripts and brackets.
	-x[i,] refer ithe row of the matrix x,x[,j] refer to the jth column
	-x[i,j] refer ij element respective
	-the subscript i and j can be numeric vectors
*Accessing elements of matrix with vector with 2 rows
usage
	object <- matrix(1:10, nrows=2)
*Accessing elements of matrix object of specfic rows
usage
	object[n,] #n is the observation
*Accessing elements of matrix  object by varaible positional notations/Column number
usage
	object[,n] #n is the variable.
*Accessing elements of matrix object by rows and columns numbers
usgage
	ojbect[r,c] # r for rows and c for columns number
#Access elements for those specific rows and some specific column name
usage
	ojbect[n,c(r,c)] 


Refer Object_matrices.R for example.

4.Arrays
-------
-An Array is an natural extension of array.
-Arrays are to matrices but can have more than two dimensions
-they are created by array functions
-like matrices, they must be single mode.

usage
	myarray <- array(vector,dimension,dinames)

*vector contains the element of the matrix
*dimensions are numeric vector giving the maximal index for each dimensions
*dimnames is an optional list of dimensions labels

-Accessing the elements of the array are a natural extension of matrices and it is similar like matrices.

Refer Object_array.R for example.

5.Data frames
-------------
-A data frame is more general than a matrix in that different column can contain diff mode of data(numeric,char and so on)
-its similar to a datasets in SAS,SPSS and SATA.
-It is the most common data structures deal with R in daily life.

usage
	mydata <- data.frame(col1,col2,col3....)
*col1,col2,col3 are the column vector of any type
*name for each column can be done via name functions

-Each column must have only one mode(data Type), but you can put columns of different modes together to form a data frame.
-They are several to identify the elements of a dataframe can be used by subscript notations or specifiying the column name.
*Accessing by positional numbers of the dataframe.
usage
	Dataframe[1:4] #From the first position till 4th position the variables are displayed.
*Accessing by specifying only with those specific variables names
usage
	dataframe[c("variablename1","Variablename2")].
*The $ notations can be used to access the particular variable from a given data frame.
usage
	dataframe$variablename
*For cross tableulate the variables by some summary of variable name.
usage
	table(dataframe$variablename1,dataframe$varibalename2)
	
		

Refer Object_dataframes.R for example

attach,detach and with
---------------------
attach()
-this attach function adds the data frame to the R search path.
-when name is encountered, data frames in the search path are checked for the variable in order.
usage 
	attach(dataframe)
	....... statment1....
	....... statment2....
	detach(dataframe)

detach()
-this functions removes the data frame from the search path.
-it does nothing to the data frame itself.
-this statement is optional and this is good programming practice and should be included routinely.

--With this approach are evident when more than one object can have the same name.

with()
- The attach() and detach() functions are best used when you're analyazing a single data frame and you're unlikely
to have multiple objects with the same name.best apporach is using with() functions.

usage
	with(dataframe,{
		statement1
		statement2
		statement3
	})
-{} brackets are evaluated with references to the dataframe.
-if there are only one statement ,the {} are optional
-the limitation of the with() function is that assignment exist only within the function brackets.
-if you need to create objects that will exists outside of the with() constructs use the special assignment operator <<- instead of the stand one <-.it saves the object to the global environment outside of the with() call.
- R recommeds using with() instead of attach() buts it is a matter of preference.

Refer Object_dataframes_attach_detach_with_function.R for example

Case Identifier
---------------
-In R case identifier can be specified with a rowname options in the data-frame functions.
-This studentid as the variable to use in labelling cases on various printouts and graphs produced by R.
usage
	studentdata <- data.frame(studentid,admindate,studentname,age,
				classe,Performance,row.names=studentid)

Refer Object_dataframes_Case_identifier.R for example

Factor
======
-Variables are described in nominal,ordinal or continous variables.
	-nominal variable are categorical without an implied order like classtype("class1","class2") data
	-Ordinal variable imply order but not amount like performance("Status","Weak","Good","Excellent")
	-Continous variable can take on any value within some range and both order and amount are implied like age			(12,13,15,17)
-Categorial (nominal) and ordered categorical(ordinal) variable in R are called factors. 
-Factors in R and they determine how data is analyzed and presented visually.
-The function factor() stores categorical values as vector of integers in the range[1..k] where k is the unique number in the nominal variable and an internal vector of character strings(the orginal values) mapped to these integers.
-Those assignment are alphabetical
-For vector representing ordinal variables , you add the parameter ordered=TRUE to the factor() function and where these assigned the variable by order like 1,2,3,4...
-By default factor levels for character vector are created in alphabetical order.
-character vector can be overfide the default by specifying the level options.

usages
	object <- factor ( variablename,order=TRUE,levels= c(values1,values2...etc));

-Numeric variables can be coded as factors using levels and labels options.if levels are coded with the orginal data , then would convert the variable to an unordered factor.Note the order of the labels must match the order of the levels. Note. if categorical variables wasn't intially coded would be set to missings.

usage 
	object <- factor ( variablename,levels= c(1,2),labels=c(value1,value2));


Refer Object_Factors.R for example


list
====
-A list is an ordered collection of object(components).
-A list allow you to gather a variety of objects under one name.
-A list may contain four components like vectors(numeric,character),matrices,data frames and even other lists.We can combine any number of objects and save them as list.
-List can be created by list() functions
Usage
	mylist <- list(object1,object2....)

-Even object can be named.
Usage
	mylist <- list(name1=object,name2=object....)
-You can access the list by a component number or name within the double brackerst.
usage
	mylist[[1]] #by component number
	mylist[["variablename") #by component name.
	mylist$variablename # this also work
-List are important R structures for two reasons.
1)they allow you to organise and recall disparate information in a simple way.
2)the results of many R functions return lists.
