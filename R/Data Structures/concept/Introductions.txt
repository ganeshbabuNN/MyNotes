What is Data Structures
=======================
-In Computer science , data structures is a way of organizing data in computer so it can be used efficiently
-In general it is based of a computer to fetch and store data at any place in its memory pointer.


Student datasets
================

studentID	AdminDate	studentName	age	class	Performance
1		10/15/2015	ganesh		12	Class1	status
2		11/16/2015	star		13	Class2	Weak
3		12/13/2015	hari		15	Class3	Good
4		14/12/2015	gana		17	Class4	Excellent

Understanding Datasets
=====================
-A data sets is usually a rectangular arrays of data with rows representing obserations and columns representing variables.
-Different traditions have different names for the rows and columsn in datasets
	-Statistics refers has observations and variables
	-Data analysts call them records and fields
	-data-mining and macine-learning roles refers them as examples and attributes.
-We can distinguish between the structures of the datasets and the conents or data types 
	-StudentID is a row or case identifier
	-admdate is a data variable
	-age is continous variable
	-class is a nominal values
	-performance is an ordinal variable.
	


DataTypes or Mode
================
-R can hanlde include numeric,character,logical(TRUE/FALSE), complex(imaginary numbers and raw(Bytes).
-In the above student dataset
	-StudentID,age,admindate is a numeric variable
	-class,perforamance,student name is a character variable
Similarly we need to tell to R that
	-student ID is a case identifier,admindate contains date,class& performance are nominal and ordinal variables
-R refers to case identifiers as row names and categorical variables (nominal,ordinal) as factors.

Data structures in general
==========================
-A data structure is a specialised format for organising and storing data.
-General data struture types includes the array,file ,record ,table ,tree and so on...
	-A array is a method for storing information on multiple devices, in general it is a number of items arranged in 
	 specificed way ex a list , a three dimensional table
	-A file , in data processing it is related to collection of records example records of each customer in a file, each
	 record would consist of fields of individual data items, such as customer name,address...so on.providing the '
	 customer information in the same fields in each record
	-In computer programming, A table is a data structure use to organise the information. In data processing a table 		 (also called an array) is a organised grouping of fields.
-Any data strucuture is designed to organise data to suit a specific purpose so that it can be accessed and worked with in apporiate ways.
-In Computer programming ,A data structures may be selected or designed to store data for the purpose on it with various algorithm
