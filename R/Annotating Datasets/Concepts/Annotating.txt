Annotating Datasets
==================
-Data analyst typically annotate datasets to make the results easier to interput.
-Annotating generally includes adding descriptive labes to variable names and value labels to the codes used for categorical variables.
-There are two ways annotating datasets
1)Variable Labels
2)Value Labels

Variable Labels
---------------
-R's ability to handle variable labels is limited.
-One approach is to use the variable label as the variable name and then refer tothe variable by its position index.
usage
	names(dataframe)[2] <- "...................labels of your choice"

refer Variable Labels.R for example	

Value Labels
------------
-the factor funciton can be used to create value labels for categorical variable.
usage

	  dataframe$variablename <- factor(dataframe$variablename, levels = c(1,2), labels= c(variable name1,variable name2)
-Levels indicates the actual values of the variable and labels refers t to a character vector containing the desired labels.
