DataTypes
=========

In java, the data types are grouped into two categories:
1)Primitive types
2)Reference types like classes, interfaces, exceptions, errors, enums, annotations, and arrays

Primitive types
===============
There are 9 primitive types in java.
Below table summarizes the categories of the primitive types:

Category	Primitive types
--------	---------------
Integers	byte, short,  int, long
floating point  numbers	float, double
Characters	char
Booleans	boolean
empty set 	void
data type	

Below table summarizes the corresponding wrapper classes, size, range, and default values:

Note:
1.   By default, all integers are initialized with 0.
2.   By default, all floating point numbers are initialized with 0.0
3.   By default, all characters are initialized with blank space.
4.   By default, all booleans are initialized with false.
5.   By default, all reference types are initialized with null.
6.   The size of the primitive data types are fixed across all operating systems.
7.   The java supports only signed integers but unsigned characters.
