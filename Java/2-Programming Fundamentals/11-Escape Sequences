Escape Sequences for Character Values
There are a number of escape sequences that are used for special characters:

the Escape Sequence	Resulting Character
\b	Backspace
\f	Form feed
\n	Linefeed character - note that it produces exactly one character, Unicode 10 (\u000A in hex)
\r	Carriage return
\t	Tab
\"	Quote mark
\'	Apostrophe
\\	Backslash
\uNNNN	Unicode value, where N is a base 16 digit from 0 through F; valid values are \u0000 through \uFFFF
\NNN	Value expressed in octal; ranging from \000 to \377
The escape sequences can either be used for single characters or within strings of text:

char c = '\u1234';
System.out.println("\t\tHello\n\t\tWorld");
