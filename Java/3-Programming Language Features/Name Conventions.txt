Name conventions
=================

-Java naming convention is a rule to follow as you decide what to name your identifiers such as class, package, variable, constant, method, etc.
-By using standard Java naming conventions, you make your code easier to read for yourself and other programmers

Class
------
-It should start with the uppercase letter.
-It should be a noun such as Color, Button, System, Thread, etc.
-Use appropriate words, instead of acronyms

ex:
class Employee {
	//code snippet
}

Interface
---------
-It should start with the uppercase letter.
-It should be an adjective such as Runnable, Remote, ActionListener.
-Use appropriate words, instead of acronyms

ex:
interface Employee {
	//code snippet
}

Method
------
-It should start with lowercase letter.
-It should be a verb such as main(), print(), println().
-If the name contains multiple words, start it with a lowercase letter followed by an uppercase letter such as actionPerformed().

ex:
class Employee {
	//method
	void draw(){
		//code snippet
	}
}

Variable
--------
-It should start with a lowercase letter such as id, name.
-It should not start with the special characters like & (ampersand), $ (dollar), _ (underscore).
-If the name contains multiple words, start it with the lowercase letter followed by an uppercase letter such as firstName, lastName. 
-Avoid using one-character variables such as x, y, z.

ex:
class Employee {
	//Variable
	int d;
	//code snippet
}

Package
-------
-It should be a lowercase letter such as java, lang.
-If the name contains multiple words, it should be separated by dots (.) such as java.util, java.lang.

package com.ganesh;
package com.ganesh.pratice;
package com.ganesh.pratice.java;


Constant
--------
-It should be in uppercase letters such as RED, YELLOW.
-If the name contains multiple words, it should be separated by an underscore(_) such as MAX_PRIORITY.
-It may contain digits but not as the first letter

class Employee {
	//constant
	static final int MIN_AGE=18;
}
