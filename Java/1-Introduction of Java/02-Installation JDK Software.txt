For Windows
===========
Step #1: Download latest stable Java software from SUN website (http://java.sun.com).
Step #2: Install JDK software by double click on .exe file.
Step #3: The following folders are created in JAVA_HOME after installing JDK.

	%JAVA_HOME%/bin
	%JAVA_HOME%/demo
	%JAVA_HOME%/include
	%JAVA_HOME%/jre
	%JAVA_HOME%/lib

Step #4: Set PATH, CLASSPATH, JAVA_HOME

Once after installing java software, we have to set JAVA_HOME, PATH, and CLASSPATH environment variables. Though setting user defined environment variable JAVA_HOME is optional, but it is recommended to set.

JAVA_HOME	
---------
-Should set to java home directory where java is installed.	
-It is a user defined environment variable.
-Create a new Varaible as JAVA_HOME = locate the home path.

PATH
----
-Should set to Java Resources folder (i.e., bin)	
-It is a system environment
for multiple use semilcolon as separater %JAVA_HOME%/bin;

CLASSPATH	
---------
-Should set to java class files(%JAVA_HOME%/jre/lib/rt.jar).	
It is a system environment variable.

For Windows
===========
Step #1: Download latest stable Java software from SUN website (http://java.sun.com).
Step #2: Install JDK software by double click on .exe file.
Step #3: The following folders are created in JAVA_HOME after installing JDK.

	%JAVA_HOME%/bin

Step #4: Set PATH, CLASSPATH, JAVA_HOME

JAVA_HOME	
---------
-Should set to java home directory where java is installed.	
-It is a user defined environment variable.

export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/Home

PATH
----
-Should set to Java Resources folder (i.e., bin)	
-It is a system environment
example :export PATH=$PATH:/usr/java/jdk1.6.0_10/bin or
%JAVA_HOME/bin

CLASSPATH	
---------
-Should set to java class files(%JAVA_HOME%/jre/lib/rt.jar).	
-It is a system environment variable.


2)For Setting up in Mac
======================
-echo $JAVA_HOME
/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_181.jdk/Contents/Home/

- ~/.bash_profile is the file where the environmental variales are maintained.
step1: cd ~/ --> go to home directory
step2: ls -1 ~/.bash_profile
step3: touch ~/.bash_profile
step4: Vim  ~/.bash_profile


Using VIM
*-------*
To make the all the .sh files executable  use the below command.
sudo chmod +x ./bin/*.sh


Vim Introductions
*---------------*
To open or create a file using Vim, run the following command, 
1)then press i to insert text into it (insert mode): (use shift : in mac)
2)Once you have modified a file, press [Esc] shift to the command mode and press :w and hit [Enter] as shown below.
3)To save the file and exit at the same time, you can use the ESC and :x key and hit [Enter]. Optionally, press [Esc] and type Shift + Z Z to save and exit the file
4)To save the file content to a new file named newname, use :w newname or :x newname and hit [Enter].

4)Different flavour of JDK
==========================
Java is now developed as OpenJDK. Most JDK binaries are based on the OpenJDK codebase, including the Oracle JDK.
Production-ready builds of JDK 11 can be downloaded from the following sources:

Oracle OpenJDK: 
OpenJDK builds by Oracle. A build is available only for the first 6 months of it's release.

AdoptOpenJDK: 
Provides prebuilt OpenJDK binaries using an open source build & test infrastructure, for more than 7 platforms (such as Linux, Windows, macOS, and Docker) with either the HotSpot or OpenJ9 JVM.

Azul Zulu OpenJDK: 
Also provides certified builds of OpenJDK for a wide array of platforms

Oracle JDK: 
Commercial Oracle branded builds of the JDK. Free for development use, but not in production.
