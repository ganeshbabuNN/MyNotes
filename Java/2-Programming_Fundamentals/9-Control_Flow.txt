Introduction
============
Control flow statements govern the flow (order) of control (execution) in a program during execution. There are three main categories of control flow statements:

Types of Statements
====================

Selection statements:
1)if
2)if-else
3)else if ladder
4)switch

Iteration statements:
1)while loop
2)do-while loop
3)Basic for loop
4)Enhanced for loops (JDK1.5)

Transfer statements:
1)break
2)continue
3)return
4)try-catch-finally
5)throw
6)assert


Selection statements
====================
-The selective statements are used to execute group of statements (block of statements) at most once i.e.,
zero or once.
-This also called as conditional statements.

1)if() statement
-----------------
It is used to decide whether block of statements are executed or not based on the <condition>.

Syntax:
	if(<condition>){
		<statement(s)>
	}

The <condition> must be boolean value but not numeric number. 
The if block will be executed only if the <condition > is true.

Example:
Int age = Integer.parseInt(args[0]); 
	If(age < 18){
		System.out.println("Your age does not permit to login to our website. ");
	}

2)if-else Statement
-------------------
The if-else statement is used to decide between two actions.

Syntax:
	If(<condition>){
		<statement(s)>
	 
	}else{
	
	}
		<statement(s)>
	}

If the <condition > is evaluated to true then if block is executed, otherwise else block is executed.

Example:
	int age = Integer.parseInt(args[0]); 
	If(age < 18){
		System.out.println("Your age does not permit to login to our website."); 
	}
	else{
		SOP("Logged into Inbox");
	}


3)else if ladder
----------------
It is used to select one among many alternatives.

Syntax:

	If(<condition1>){
		<statement(s)>
		}else if(<conditon2>){
		<statement(s)>
 
	}
		?
	else{

	} 
	<statement(s)>
 	}

The final else block is executed only if none of the above <condition>s are true.

Example:

if(false){
}else if(false){

}else if(false){

}else{    //Else block is executed since all above if() blocks are evaluated to false.

}

4)switch
---------
Switch statement is used to choose one among many alternative actions.

Syntax:
	switch(<switch expression>){
	case label1: <statement(s)>
	case label2: <statement(s)>
	?
	case labeln: <statement(s)>
	default: <statement(s)>
	}

The valid <switch expression> types are:
-byte, short, int, char, but not long
-Byte, Short, Integer, Character, but not Long

The valid case label types are:
-byte, short, int, char values but not long value, but not any wrapper classes.

Example:
Program: Display Day name

class SwitchDemo{
public static void main(String[] args){
int day = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
switch(day){
	case 1: System.out.println("Monday"); break;
	case 2: System.out.println("Tuesday"); break;
	case 3: System.out.println("Wednesday");  break; case 4: System.out.println("Thursday"); break; case 5: System.out.println("Friday"); break;
	case 6: System.out.println("Saturday");break;
	case 7: System.out.println("Sunday"); break;
	default: System.out.println("Valid options are: (1-7)");
	}
   }
}

Iteration Statements
====================
The iterate statements are used to execute block of statements repeatedly until the boolean <condition> becomes false.

1)While Loop
------------
In case of while loop, the <condition> will be evaluated before executing body.
Syntax:

while (<condition>){
	< body>
 }

The <condition> is always boolean value.

Example
Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10.
Int I =1;
While(I <= 10){ 
 System.out.print(I+?\t?); I++;
}

2)do-while loop
---------------
In case of do-while,  the body is executed before <condition> is evaluated i.e., the body will be
executed atleast once.

Syntax:

do {
<body>
} while (<condition>);                   //Watch: Semicolon at the end.

Example:
Write a program to add numbers from 1 to 10;
Int I = 1;
Int sum = 0;
Do{
Sum  += I; I++;
}while(i<=10);


Difference between while and do-while:
======================================
While :The <condition> is evaluated before executing the body. Hence, while loop executes zero or more times.

Do-While :The body will be executed before the <condition> is evaluated. Hence, the body would be executed one or more times i.e., body will be executed at least once.

3)Basic for loop(Simple or General For Loop):
This loop is best suitable if we know the number of iterations in advance.
For example, reading array elements or reading collection elements.

Syntax:

for (<initialization>; <condition>; <increment or decrement>){
  <body>
}

Example:
Write a program to add array elements using for loop.
Int[] arr = {10,20,30,40}; 
Int sum = 0;
for(int i=0; I < arr.length; i++){ 
Sum  += arr[i];
}
Sop(?The total=?+sum);


4)Enhanced for (or for-each) loop:
This is first time introduced in jdk1.5. This is the most convenient loop for retrieving elements from array or collection.
This loop cannot be used for general purpose.
This loop iterate elements always in forward direction but not in reverse direction.

Syntax:
for(<element declaration> : <array or collection name>){
	<body>
}
Where type of <element declaration> is same as array type or collection type.

Example:
Int[] arr = {10,20,30};
*Basic for loop-
for(int I = 0; I < arr.length; I++){ SOP(arr[i]);
}
The basic for loop uses array
index to read array data.

*Enhanced for loop
for(int e : arr){ SOP(e);
}
The Enhanced for loop directly uses element but not index. Hence, simple to use.

Note:
1.   Enhanced for loop is used only with arrays and collections but not for general purpose.
2.   Enhanced for loop cannot be used to retrieve elements in reverse order.

Transfer Statements
===================
1)Break
The 'break' is used to come out of the loops.
We can use break statement in one of the following cases:
1)Inside loops
2)Inside switch

Example
For(int I=0 ; I<10;  i++){
For(int j=0; j<10; j++){
If(i==j)  break;   //the nearest for loop will be terminated.
}
}

2)Continue
The continue statement is used to transfer the execution back to the start of the loop i.e., the
remaining statements after continue will be skipped.

Example:
Write a program to add even numbers but print odd numbers.
Int sum = 0;
for(int i = 0; i<=10; i++ ){
	if(i%2 == 0){ //even number
	sum+= I;             //Adding even numbers
	continue;
}
	System.out.print (i+?\t?);            //Printing odd numbers
}
	Sop(?The sum of even numbers is:?+sum);
}


3)return
The return statement is always used from method block. The return statement is used to stop execution of a method and transfer control back to the method calling. 

There are two forms of the return statement:
a)return;                //Optionally used with methods whose return type is void or from constructor.
b)return <expression>; //Must be used with methods whose return type is other than void.

A void method need not have a return statement ? in which case the control normally returns to the caller after the last statement in the method?s body has been executed.
However, a void method can optionally specify the first form of the return statement ? in which case the control immediately transferred to the method caller

Example:
Program: Write a program to return maximum number
int max(int x, int y){ If(x > y)
	else
}
(or)
Return x; Return y;
int max(int x, int y){
	return x>y?x:y;  //ternary operator
}
