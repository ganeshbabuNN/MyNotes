Class
=====
A class is a template or blueprint.

Syntax:
<class modifiers> class <class name> [extends clause] [implements clause]{ 
	[field declarations]
	[constructor declarations] 
	[method declarations]
}

The UML (Unified Modeling Language) notation for the class is:

Example:

Assume Box is a example

Box
int Width; 
int height; 
int depth;
Box(int, int, int)
in volume()

Now we shall construct using the BOX class.
class Box{
//Field declaration
	int width; 
	int height; 
	int depth;
//Constructor
	Box(int w, int h, int d){ 
		width = w; 
		height = h; 
		depth=d;
//Method declaration
	int volume(){
	return width*height*depth;
	}
}


Object
======
Instance of a class is called as an object. In java, object is created using ?new? keyword. 
The object creation process involves following three steps:
*Declaring reference variable
*Construction an object using ?new? keyword.
*Assigning Reference value (address) to reference variable.

Example:
Box b = new Box(1,2,3);

*The fields of a class is also called as attribute, properties, instance variable, or data member.
*The methods of a class is also called as behavior, operation, instance method, or method member. 
*The data member and method member of a class is called as member of a class.
*The new keyword creates an object and returns the reference value to the reference variable.
