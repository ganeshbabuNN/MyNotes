First Program
using command prompot or terminal
Testing the input and output 

First program
=============
-Remember R is a case sensitive language

using print function
--------------------
-we just need a print function. No need of any packages or main functions, just a simple print function is enough---------
print("hello world")

print() is a function which is used to print the values on to the output screen,It also has arguments, we can use it if needed

-if you don't want the quotes
print("hello world",quote=FALSE)

using functions
---------------
-Not really required but demostrating the possible way for running hello world program
new.hello <- function(){
  print("Hello world")
}

-calling the function
new.hello()

using command prompt or terminal
=================================
-open a notepad and type "print("hello world") and save the notepad as "helloworld.r
-go to command prompt and location the location of the R file saved and call the R file
 Rscript helloworld.r

testing the input and output 
===========================

reading the input from the users
---------------------------------
there are two ways
-Using readline() method
-Using scan() method

readline() method
*---------------*
-In R language readline() method takes input in string format. If one inputs an integer then it is inputted as a string
-here we use <- or = operator to store the output.

Syntax:
var = readline();
var = as.integer(var);

# taking input as string
var =readline(prompt='Enter your name: ')

# taking input as number and converting to number
var =readline(prompt='Enter your number: ')
#as.integer(n); —> convert to integer
var=as.integer(var);

simillary 
#as.numeric(n); —> convert to numeric type (float, double etc)
#as.complex(n); —> convert to complex number (i.e 3+2i)
#as.Date(n) —> convert to date …, etc

# taking multiple inputs
{
name =readline(prompt='Enter your name: ')
age =readline(prompt='Enter your age: ')
place =readline(prompt='Enter your place: ')
}

print(name)
print(age)
print(place)

scan() method
*---------------*
This method takes input from the console. This method is a very handy method while inputs are needed to taken quickly for any mathematical calculation or for any dataset
scan() method is taking input continuously, to terminate the input process, need to press Enter key 2 times on the console

Syntax:
x = scan()

#taking input, default takes as number ! enter blank enter to quit the process
name=scan()

#to read as integer
age=scan(what=integer())
#to read as double
age=scan(what=double())
#to read as character
place=scan(what=character())
#to read a file and also the above parameter are applied for character and double.
file=scan("C:\\GBAG_Back\\MyTraining\\R\\1-Introduction\\test.txt")

Printing the output of the user
--------------------------------
using the print() functions 
print("hello world")

*there are source() and sink() function which helps great during file handling.

Using cat functions
cat("hello world")

Help info
---------
help(print) #Getting help on a function that you know the name of ? or help
?print
example(paste) #Use the example function to see examples of how to use it.
example(`for`)

demo() #The demo function gives longer demonstrations of how to use a function.
demo(package = .packages(all.available = TRUE)) # all demos
demo(plotmath)
demo(graphics)

*lot of more to see in variable chapater
