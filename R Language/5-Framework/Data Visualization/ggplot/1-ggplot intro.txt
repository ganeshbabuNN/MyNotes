Intro
======

-ggplot2 is a powerful package for data visualisation
-Graphs are constructed in a “layered” format, where each layer adds a specific feature to the graph (e.g.
points, lines, bars, boxplots, labels, titles etc).
-A typical example sequence of a ggplot function call is as follows

ggplot(dataset1, aes Variable_X , Variable_Y ))  -> Calls the data and the variables to plot
geom_< type>() -> Defines the graph type (e.g.geom_boxplot , geom_barchart)
xlab(“Variable X”) ->Adds x axis label
ylab(“Variable Y”) -> Adds y axis label
ggtitle(“Example Adds a title") ->Adds a title

Types of layers in ggplot
=========================
-Many of the layers used in a ggplot sequence are simply formatting or fine tuning, and don’t require R to do anything per se with the data variables, for example:
Axis labels ( xlab (), ylab
Graph title ( ggtitle
Axis scale ( scale_x_continuous
Colour/style theme ( theme_<type>()
-The layers that actually provide data visualisation (e.g. points, bars, lines, boxplots, regression calculations) are referred to as the geometry commands (e.g. geom_barchart ()(), geom_line ()(), geom_boxplot () etc)
-Importantly, we need to inform R which variables in the data should be used in the geometry commands. This is referred to as the aesthetics aes command mapping the variables to the geometries.

Managing the aes()
==================
-There are two important considerations with the aes () command:
-Any variables you want to plot must go inside the aes().
-You can capture aes () either in the ggplot () call, or in the specific geom _<type>() calls later
	For the majority of cases this makes no difference


-However there is a subtle difference
-Putting aes () in ggplot () will map the variables to all geometries (points, lines, regression etc)
-Sometimes we might not want this. For example, we might want flexibility to map some variables against points and other variables against lines in this case its better to have aes () in the geom _<type> layers.


Commonts used
=============
#Axis labels can be changed with xlab () and ylab
ggplot (data)+ geom_point(aes (x, y)) +xlab (“Variable X”) + ylab(“Variable")

#Plot title can be added with ggtitle
ggplot(data) +geom_point(aes(x, y)) +ggtitle(“Example")

#Axis scales can be altered with scale_x_continuous () and scale_y_continuous
ggplot (data)+ geom_point(aes (x, y)) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(axis min, axis max), breaks = seq axis min, axis max, interval)

#geom_smooth () allows us to a draw line through data points
ggplot (data, aes x,y )) +geom_point() + geom_smooth()
ggplot (data, aes x,y )) +geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
