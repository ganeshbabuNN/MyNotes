there are four main basic plots have been used so far
1)scatter plot :the scatterplot chart (or dot chart) is used to examine the relationship between two numeric variables
2)Line chart :a line chart is used to display data that change continously over time
3)Bar chart :a bar chart is used to compare values accross categories using vertical or horizontal bars
4)Histograms : a histogram visually represents the distribution of a random variable
5)piechart :A pie chart is a circular graphical view of data.
6)box plots: a boxplot is a standardized way to display,a variable distribution by using five summary indicators minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, maximum

PLOTTING FUNCTIONS
==================
the R program can plot functions of one variable
suppose we have to plot the following function

f <- function (x) { x^2 + x + 1 }

to plot it, we use the plot() function
--------------------------------------
plot(f)

the default domain is 0-1 but we can change that using the xlim parameter
plot(f, xlim = c(-100, 100))

change the line color and thickness
-----------------------------------
plot(f, xlim = c(-100, 100),
     col = "red", lwd = 2)

plot another function
---------------------
f2 <- function (x) { (exp(x) + 1)/(x - 1) }

we set the domain to (-5, 5) 
plot(f2, xlim = c(-5, 5))
