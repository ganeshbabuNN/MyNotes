there are four main basic plots have been used so far
1)scatter plot :the scatterplot chart (or dot chart) is used to examine the relationship between two numeric variables
2)Line chart :a line chart is used to display data that change continously over time
3)Bar chart :a bar chart is used to compare values accross categories using vertical or horizontal bars
4)Histograms : a histogram visually represents the distribution of a random variable
5)piechart :A pie chart is a circular graphical view of data.
6)box plots: a boxplot is a standardized way to display,a variable distribution by using five summary indicators minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, maximum

BOXPLOTS
=========
a boxplot is a standardized way to display
a variable distribution by using five summary indicators: minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, maximum

to create a boxplot we use the boxplot() function

x <- rnorm(100)
boxplot(x)

change the color of the box
---------------------------
boxplot(x, col = "red")

add title and axis labels
--------------------------
boxplot(x, col = "red",
        main = "Boxplot",
        xlab = "x", ylab = "Values")

plot two boxplots in the same chart
-----------------------------------
simulate a categorical variable (dichotomous)

category <- sample(1:2, 100, replace = TRUE)
category

draw the boxplot for the variable x
-----------------------------------
in each category
boxplot(x~category, col = "red")

make the boxes of different colors
----------------------------------
boxplot(x~category, col = c("red", "green"))

we can create a violin chart
-----------------------------
by setting the notch option to TRUE
boxplot(x, col = "red", notch = TRUE)

boxplot(x~category, col = c("red", "green"), notch = TRUE)
