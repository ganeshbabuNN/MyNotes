Facets
=========
-Facets offer another way of adding more variables to plots, instead of using aesthetic approaches like colour, shape or size (example from the ggplot2::diamonds data set)
-There are two types of facet functions in ggplot2: facet_grid() and facet_wrap()
-facet_grid() is for when you have 2 additional variables you want to map (e.g. cut AND clarity). One variable is positioned along the rows and another down the columns, creating a grid.
	ggplot(diamonds) +
	geom_point(aes(carat, price)) +
	facet_grid(cut ~ clarity)

-Its possible to switch cut and clarity in the code if you want to switch columns/row display

-facet_wrap() is best when you have only 1 additional variable you want to map (e.g. cut). facet_wrap allows you to specify the number of rows (nrow=) or number of columns (ncol=) in the facet
	ggplot(diamonds) +
	geom_point(aes(carat, price)) +
	facet_wrap(~ cut, nrow = 1)


#facegrid
ggplot(diamonds)+ geom_point(aes(carat, price)) +facet_grid (cut~clarity)

#facet_wrap () 
ggplot(diamonds)+ geom_point(aes(carat, price)) +facet_wrap(~ cut,nrow =1)


Quiz
====
use mpg datasets
1)Create a plot of ‘displ’ (x axis) vs ‘hwy’ (y axis) that is facetted by ‘manufacturer’. Ensure the plot has 2 rows
2. Create a plot of ‘displ’ (x axis) vs ‘hwy’ (y axis) that is facetted by ‘drv’ and ‘class’. Ensure that each rows
corresponds to a specific observation in the ‘drv’ variable, and that each column corresponds to a specific
observation in the ‘class’ variable
