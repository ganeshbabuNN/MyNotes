=====
there are four main basic plots have been used so far
1)scatter plot :the scatterplot chart (or dot chart) is used to examine the relationship between two numeric variables
2)Line chart :a line chart is used to display data that change continously over time
3)Bar chart :a bar chart is used to compare values accross categories using vertical or horizontal bars
4)Histograms : a histogram visually represents the distribution of a random variable
5)piechart :A pie chart is a circular graphical view of data.
6)box plots: a boxplot is a standardized way to display,a variable distribution by using five summary indicators minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, maximum

PIE CHARTS
==========
let's represent the average wage by country,using a pie chart

country <- c("Germany", "Switzerland", "Italy", "Portugal")
wage <- c(44900, 58300, 34100, 24100)

we use the pie() function for this
----------------------------------
pie(wage)

add labels to the chart
-----------------------
pie(wage, labels = country)

change the sector colors
------------------------
pie(wage, labels = country,
    col = c("red", "green", "blue", "orange"))

add a custom title
------------------
pie(wage, labels = country,
    col = c("red", "green", "blue", "orange"),
    main = "Average Wages per Country")

change the font size
--------------------
pie(wage, labels = country,
    col = c("red", "green", "blue", "orange"),
    main = "Average Wages per Country",
    cex.main = 0.9, cex = 0.8)

add the percentages to the labels
---------------------------------
perc <- 100 * (wage/sum(wage))
perc <- round(perc, 0)
perc

labels <- paste(country, perc)
labels
labels <- paste0(labels, "%")
labels

pie(wage, labels = labels)

we can get a polygon instead of a pie setting the edges option to TRUE
pie(wage, labels = country,
    col = c("red", "green", "blue", "orange"),
    main = "Average Wages per Country", edges = TRUE)
