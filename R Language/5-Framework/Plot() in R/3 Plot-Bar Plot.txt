there are four main basic plots have been used so far
1)scatter plot :the scatterplot chart (or dot chart) is used to examine the relationship between two numeric variables
2)Line chart :a line chart is used to display data that change continously over time
3)Bar chart :a bar chart is used to compare values accross categories using vertical or horizontal bars
4)Histograms : a histogram visually represents the distribution of a random variable
5)piechart :A pie chart is a circular graphical view of data.
6)box plots: a boxplot is a standardized way to display,a variable distribution by using five summary indicators minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, maximum

Bar Chart
=========
A bar chart is used to compare values accross categories , using vertical or horizontal bars
take the following data about the average wage ,in four European countries

country <- c("Germany", "Switzerland", "Italy", "Portugal")
wage <- c(44900, 58300, 34100, 24100)

to plot the average wage by contry as a bar chart
-------------------------------------------------
we use the barplot() function

barplot(wage, names = country)

adding a title, axes labels and limits to the y axis
----------------------------------------------------
barplot(wage, names = country, main = "Average Wage by Country",
        xlab = "Countries", ylab = "Average Wage",
        cex.main = 1.1, ylim = c(0, 58300))

set the bar colors
------------------
unique color
barplot(wage, names = country, col = "red")

alternate color
barplot(wage, names = country, col = c("red", "green"))

different colors for each bar
barplot(wage, names = country, 
        col = c("red", "green", "violet", "orange"))

change the bar border
---------------------
barplot(wage, names = country, 
        col = "red", 
        border = "darkgreen")

change the space between bars
-----------------------------
default space value is 0.2

barplot(wage, names = country, 
        col = "red",
        space = 0)

barplot(wage, names = country, 
        col = "red",
        space = 0.5)

barplot(wage, names = country, 
        col = "red",
        space = 10)
