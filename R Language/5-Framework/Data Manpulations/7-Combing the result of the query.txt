Intro 
how to combine the results of two queries into a single result
how to make an intersection of the results of two independent queries

Intro
======
this is possible at the vector level not at the dataframe level.

first <- mtcars[1:20, ]
second <- mtcars[10:32,]
mtcars$model <- rownames(mtcars)
mtcars

how to combine the results of two queries into a single result
==============================================================
#load the dplyr package
library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)

Union
-----
-only keeps unique records, non duplicates
The union of two sets is everything in the two sets taken together, but counting elements only once that are common to both sets.
These functions override the set functions provided in base to make them generic so that efficient versions for data frames and other tables can be provided.

union(first,second)

union_all
---------
-inclues, non duplicates

union_all(first,second)

how to make an intersection of the results of two independent queries
=====================================================================
The intersection of two sets is the material that they have in common:

intersect(first, second)


setdiff generally checks if first datasets is not there in second
-----------------------------------------------------------------
setdiff(first, second)

setdiff(second,first)

Short example
=============
using dataframe
---------------
a <- data.frame(column = c(1:10, 10))
b <- data.frame(column = c(1:5, 5))
a
b

union(a,b) #combines all, but unique
union_all(a,b), combine all 
intersect(a,b) #which are common in both
setdiff(a,b) #displays values from a are not there in B
setdiff(b,a) #displays values from b are not there in A

using vector
------------
setA<-c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e")
setB<-c("d", "e", "f", "g")

union(setA,setB)
intersect(setA,setB)
setdiff(setA,setB)
setdiff(setB,setA)
all(c(setdiff(setA,setB),intersect(setA,setB),setdiff(setB,setA))== union(setA,setB))
setequal(c(setdiff(setA,setB),intersect(setA,setB),setdiff(setB,setA)),union(setA,setB))
setA %in% setB
