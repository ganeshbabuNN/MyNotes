Bar Plots
=========
-geom_bar () provides offers a barchart aesthetic, although they are a bit more complex to manage
-The default is to define only the x variable and R simply counts the number of observations
	ggplot(data) +
		geom_bar(aes(x axis variable))
-If we want to have a variable on the y axis rather than default observation count, we need to define stat ="Identity"
	ggplot(data) +
		geom_bar(aes (x axis variable, y axis), stat = “identity”)

-As with geom_points () and geom_boxplot () we can define the colour or fill of the bars
	ggplot(data) +	
		geom_bar(aes (x axis variable, y axis), stat = “identity” , fill = “red")
-We can also link an additional variable (e.g. varZ ) to the fill colour. In this case R automatically “stacks” the different colour coding, but we can also have the bars adjacent using positions = “dodge”
	ggplot(data) +	
		geom_bar(aes (x axis variable, y axis, fill = varZ ”), position = “dodge", stat = “identity")

library(ggplot2)
#Default
ggplot(diamonds) +geom_bar(aes(cut))

#Fill = cut
ggplot(diamonds) +geom_bar(aes(cut,fill=cut))

#Fill = clarity (stacking is default)
ggplot(diamonds) +geom_bar(aes(cut,fill=clarity))

#Fill = clarity / position = “dodge”
ggplot(diamonds) +geom_bar(aes(cut,fill=clarity),position = "dodge")

#y = price (stat = “identity”)
ggplot(diamonds) +geom_bar(aes(cut,price),stat = "identity")

#y = price (stat = “identity”) / fill = clarity
ggplot(diamonds) +geom_bar(aes(cut,price,fill=clarity),stat = "identity")

Quiz
====
1)Create a barchart with Species as the x axis
2)Modify the plot so that Species is colour coded
3)Create a new barchart with Species on the x axis and Petal.Length on the y axis. Colour code according to Species
