Introduction
============
In R we have 

Command Prompt
==============
-# We can use the print() function
print("Hello World!")

## Quotes can be suppressed in the output
print("Hello World!", quote = FALSE)

## If there are more than 1 item, we can concatenate using paste()
print(paste("How","are","you?"))

#print is a statement
#Hello world! is a string literals
#paste is functions and statement

Using Function
==============

hello <- function() {
  print("hello world")
}

hello()

#hellow is a function name which is an identifier
#function is a keyword
#print is a statement
#function has its syntax

Using Class
===========
studentDetails <- list(name="ganesh",age=43,contact="india",grade=12) #studentdetails contains the list of elements passing a list
class(studentDetails)<-"studentinfo" 
studentDetails #call

# studentinfo and studentDetails new created class
#class is a keyword
#studentdetails is a identifier
#name,age,contact,grade are the identifier as well and act as a argument for list

Help info
=========
help(print) #Getting help on a function that you know the name of ? or help
?print
example(paste) #Use the example function to see examples of how to use it.
example(`for`)

demo() #The demo function gives longer demonstrations of how to use a function.
demo(package = .packages(all.available = TRUE)) # all demos
demo(plotmath)
demo(graphics)

#functional searching
??regression #Finding a function that you don't know the name of Use ?? or, equivalently, help.search.
help.search("regression")
??"logistic regression"#Again, non-standard names and phrases need to be quoted.
apropos("a$") # apropos finds functions and variables in the current session-space (but not in installed but not-loaded packages) that match a regular expression.
RSiteSearch("logistic regression") #findFn in sos wraps RSiteSearch returning the results as a HTML table.

#packages info
View(available.packages()) #available.packages tells you all the packages that are available in the repositories that you set via setRepositories.
View(installed.packages()) # installed.packages tells you all the packages that you have installed in all the libraries specified in .libPaths
library() # library (without any arguments) is similar, returning the names and tag-line of installed packages
.libPaths() #.libPaths gets/sets the library trees within which packages are looked for.

data() #data with no arguments tells you which datasets are available on your machine.
search()#search tells you which packages have been loaded.
packageDescription("utils")    #packageDescription shows you the contents of a package's DESCRIPTION file. Likewise news read the NEWS file

ls() #ls lists the variables in an global environment
ls(all.names = TRUE) # including names beginning with '.'
ls("package:broom")     # everything for the sp package
str(a) #Most variables can be inspected using str or summary.
summary(a) #it is used for the dataframe to summarize the descriptive statistics
glimpse(a) #its is similar to summary 

#directorys
getwd() # print the current working directory - cwd
ls()    # list the objects in the current workspace

setwd(mydirectory)      # change to mydirectory
setwd("c:/docs/mydir")  # note / instead of \ in windows
setwd("/usr/rob/mydir") # on linux

# view and set options for the session
help(options) # learn about available options
options() # view current option settings
options(digits=3) # number of digits to print on output

# work with your previous commands
history() # display last 25 commands
history(max.show=Inf) # display all previous commands

# save your command history
savehistory(file="myfile") # default is ".Rhistory"

# recall your command history
loadhistory(file="myfile") # default is ".Rhistory"

# save the workspace to the file .RData in the cwd
save.image()

# save specific objects to a file
# if you don't specify the path, the cwd is assumed
save(object list,file="myfile.RData")

# load a workspace into the current session
# if you don't specify the path, the cwd is assumed
load("myfile.RData")

q() # quit R. You will be prompted to save the workspace.

#removing all the objects in workspace
rm(list=setdiff(ls(), ""))
rm(list=setdiff(ls(), "x")) #removing all the objects in workspace one object
'x is the object
rm(list=c('EX')) #removing specific objects from workspace single objects
rm(list=c('EX','DM'))#removing specific objects from workspace for multiple objects

Note Handling files in R
-------------------
R gets confused if you use a path in your code like:
c:\mydocuments\myfile.txt

This is because R sees "\" as an escape character. Instead, use:
c:\\my documents\\myfile.txt
c:/mydocuments/myfile.txt
