Introduction
============
-Constants are entities within a program whose value can't be changed
-There are 2 basic types of constant. These are numeric constants and character constants.

Numeric Constants
----------------
All the numbers you will be using within a program fall under this category. There are sub types like integer, double or complex, which is checked usng typeof() function. Example:
typeof (6)
typeof (4L)

characters constants
-------------------
These can be signified by means of either single quotes (') or using double quotes (") as delimiters.
'ganesh'
typeof("ganesh")

Delecration of variables
=========================
-In really there is no such called constants in python, but in case if we want to use

Assigning values to variable
=============================
- You can denote the constant in UPPER Case. this is just a suggestions

constants.R
	PI=31.42
	SQRTA= 32.

testconstants.R
	import constants
	print(constants.PI)
	print(constants.SQRTA)
